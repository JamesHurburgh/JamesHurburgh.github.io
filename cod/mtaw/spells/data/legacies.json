				"Text" : "They have been with us since before the beginning. Before Atlantis called. Before apes learned to walk upright and pile stones atop one another to make their caves. Before man chose to set himself apart from beasts and trees and rocks, they knew the truth: that the circle of life is broad enough to include all things “organic”and “inorganic,”that this great wheel turns easily from one form to another, that man and beast and tree and rock are one. It was they who first took to the grazing-fields, to follow the comings and goings of the herds. And when they had learned the steps of the herddance and could sing the words of the herd-song, they put on themselves the skins of the herd-dress and slept in the cold and rain until they became part of the herd itself. It was they who first ran with the wolves and learned the worth of honesty when the wolves pointed toward unseen prey in hopes of sharing the kill. And it was they who stalked against the great cats and learned the value of deception, letting other hunters pass by in hopes of keeping the “lion’s share” of the kill for themselves. They it was who flew with the birds, crept with the vines and slept with the stones. They went where others could not go and did what others could not do. They learned the lessons that life taught from every angle and brought their knowledge back to their tribes to teach the business of living. They sought wisdom to lead their tribes out of darkness and cold and hunger, and set mankind on a path that would eventually lead to civilization. But mankind mistook its new powers of stewardship over the land as mastery, and regarded the animals, plants and rocks only as resources to be plundered rather than as partners in the circle of life. In their hubris, they forgot the wisdom that they had taught and dismissed their utterances as backward superstition. They who had sacrificed the semblance of their humanity for the greater good were now cast out. Ostracized and despised, they were relegated to the status of monsters and bogeymen used to frighten unruly children. The mighty warriors who had once donned hide and claw and fang in the service of their people were now cast in the role of bloodthirsty murderer. Those who lived by the old lore of leaf and stone were hunted down and torn to pieces or burned in public spectacle. The horns and hooves of the most sacred were denounced as emblems of evil. All the oldest languages of the world once had a name for them, most now forgotten. In modern English, they are known as the Orphans of Proteus, for their metamorphosis ability. Some say they, not the Atlanteans, were the very first humans to Awaken, and some even go so far as to suggest that all other types of magic are derived from theirs. Whether that is true or not, many now consider them to be a dying breed. Marginalized by the encroachment of civilization, they are usually found only at the fringes of mage society. They engage in few formalities, and the kinship of spirit they share is something that is felt, unspoken, deep within their souls. Inheritors of the Proteus Legacy can be unnerving, not only to other mages, but to those who know nothing of magic. Social customs and mores —at least, those of the modern civilized world —mean little to them, and they may at times break laws, cross boundaries or ignore table manners and dress codes without compunction. This is not to say that they are dumb brutes. Members may exhibit as much intelligence and compassion as any other sorcerer. They tend to be plain spoken, even rudely blunt, and act impulsively upon primal urges known only to them. For those who have experienced the non-human world directly, such phrases as “nature red in tooth and claw”or “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower”are no mere poetic conceits, but the very bedrock of reality."

				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "The more time an Orphan spends using her attainments —whether they provide animal, vegetable or mineral features —the more likely she is to physically resemble that form in some way. Common features include excessive hairiness, a forward-slumping posture, enlarged teeth and nails, overdeveloped ears or nose, iridescent eyes, dermatological conditions that cause the skin to resemble the bark of a tree, or an angular craggy profile like the face of a cliff. In general, all scratches, scars, rashes, infections and other outwardly visible ailments that might mark the mage while in animal form remain visible in an analogous place on his human form, (although these features tend to fade over time if the Orphan avoids frequent use of his attainments)."

				"Text" : "It is generally assumed that Orphans come almost exclusively from beyond the fringes of civilization — rural areas, remote wildernesses or underdeveloped nations —and this is often the case. As such places dwindle and disappear, however, more inheritors of the Proteus Legacy can be found in cities and suburbs, taking on the forms of domesticated animals, cultivated plants and manufactured objects. Of these, some may be descendants of tribal cultures that knew and respected the power of the Orphans, while others have rejected modern culture and attempt to reconstruct and/or reclaim earlier values that they consider to be safer, healthier and (so to speak) more humane."

While they are often initiated into one order or another (although some are apostates), they tend to spurn the traditional politics and schemes of Awakened society, retreating to the wilderness as soon as they adopt this Legacy. Most Orphans tend to be either solitary hermits or isolated, clannish groups, so they have little in the way of overall social organization. Affinity groups may spontaneously form along the lines of preferred habitats, species, phylum or kingdom. Regional groups tend to form around places like virgin wilderness, wildlife refuges or well-conceived parks as protection, or as a response against urban expansion, dumping sites and other ecological crime scenes. Communication is generally conducted through non-human media, with speech expressed in the languages of animals, and with “written”messages formed by anomalous plant growth or geological formations. Orphans tend to claim certain territories, which brings them into conflict with other supernatural beings that might want such territories for their own purposes. Some Orphans are nomadic, following the migratory patterns of birds or herd animals, or the hunting habits of certain predators."

This action can be made reflexive in turn by spending one Willpower point. The user can also communicate with animals in their own language of behaviors, growls, grunts, cues and/or markings.

She must choose her unique feature upon gaining this attainment, and cannot change it thereafter. The shift lasts for up to one hour per activation. Any natural weapon (claws, fangs) she gains adds two dice to attack rolls (and damage is lethal), while a protective feature (fur, tree bark) provides two armor points. The character can also now heal aggravated wounds using Snake Skin (above), but it also requires the expenditure of one Mana. Optional Arcanum: Matter 3 If the mage also knows Matter 3, her unique transformative feature could be mineral rather than organic. She might shift her fists or feet into stone, or cover her epidermis with a layer of thin, flexible shale “scales.”Stone fists or feet add four dice to punches or kicks, but the damage is bashing instead of lethal.

If she chooses a plant form instead of an animal, she is inanimate but can communicate with any nearby plant based spirits without needing the Spirit Arcanum, or if she journeys through Astral Space while her body is in plant form, she can interact with the ancient plant spirits of the Dreamtime. Optional Arcanum: Matter 4 If the mage also knows Matter 4, she could choose stone as her shapeshifting form, changing herself into a rock. She cannot move, although she can perceive her surroundings. The obvious use for this version of the attainment is camouflage, but it provides another unique benefit.

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "Often upon Awakening, fledgling mages turn dismissive of the mundane material world. Having penetrated the veil of lies and illusion, they stand upon the threshold of a whole new world so dazzling that they tend to forget their previous mode of existence. They reckon that the old rules no longer apply to them. Admitted into a new confraternity of like souls, they draw away from their families and friends, who cannot understand their new vision and abilities. Now able to transcend the gross limitations of matter and energy, some even neglect their own corporeal bodies, regarding them as a mere hindrances, husks to be discarded once their usefulness has ended. While there is some truth to this way of thinking, it is not a whole truth. It is a road that leads to dissolution and disembodiment. The Perfected Adeptsstand as a warning sign upon that road, reminding all mages where they came from and what their ultimate goal is, or should be. Their presence signifies a return to the source, a remembrance that all mages are still human beings —they are born, live their lives and die. If magic cannot be made to enrich and fulfill that process, then it is not magic but delusion. The Adepts teach that before one can truly transcend the limitations of being human, one must learn what the true limitations of humanity are. Furthermore, they teach that the wisdom gained through transcendence must be brought back to humanity, so as to enable others to follow the same road. A human being is a work in progress, they hold. Awakening is not the completion of that work, but the opportunity for completion, for perfection. And yet, the task of perfecting oneself cannot be accomplished while still entangled in the web of lies and illusion. Though the Adepts do not disdain or reject the affairs the material world, they do require a substantial removal in order to pursue their goals. Renunciation of worldly attachments or wealth is the first necessary step for disentangling oneself from the world. Adepts tend to retreat into hermitages or cloistered communities, both magical and mundane, in order to disconnect from influences that distract from self-observation and cultivation. They simplify their lives, shunning extraneous noise and clutter so that they can hear the murmurs of their innermost selves. Once a suitable degree of quietude and simplification is attained, an Adept begins the process of perfection by concentrating upon the base from which his consciousness springs, his own physical body. With worldly concerns out of the way, the first thing that the Adept may notice are the noises and sensations that come from within his corporeal frame. True calm and peace of mind are not possible while the body exists in a state of discomfort or disease, or even less than optimal health. A strict regimen of adjusted diet and exercise must be undertaken to ensure that the body does not distract from the clarity of the mind. The Perfected Adepts consider martial training to be the most effective type of physical exercise for their purposes. In addition to building strength and flexibility, the student is taught to focus mind and body to function as a unified whole. Besides enhancing the capability of the body, martial arts have a calming effect upon the mind by instilling knowledge and confidence to deal with direct physical threats. Discipline and perseverance, also necessary in magical training, are encouraged and honed. (Asian martial arts in particular incorporate esoteric elements such as focused meditation and occult physiology that perfectly complement the study of magic.) Most systematized fighting styles around the world include some ethical principles whereby practitioners are exhorted to aid and protect those of lesser ability, an ideal that the Adepts proudly espouse. As the mind works at perfecting the body, it also learns to operate upon itself, gaining mastery over thought and emotion rather than being ruled by them. Just as the distractions of the outer world can be dispelled, just as the wants and urgings of the body can be quelled, so can the chatter and babble of the lower mind be silenced, leaving the soul free hear what it most needs to tell itself. Only when everything has fallen away can the innermost self be free to seek perfection by uniting the highest reality with the lowest. To some this union might seem to be the ultimate goal, the reason for a mage’s existence. But for the Perfected Adepts, this is not the end of their work, but the beginning. Perfection is meaningless if it is static and removed from the world, so the Adept is obligated to return to the world and help others to find the way to inner peace. The Adept’s martial prowess makes him a natural champion and protector, but perfection is not bound to any one role. The patience and discipline that mark an Adept’s training make him suitable for a number of callings, from the most repetitive of mindless menial labor to the most arcane and convoluted of intellectual pursuits such as science or philosophy. In this way, the Perfected Adept brings perfection into an imperfect world, making himself an exemplar for others to follow and by which to measure themselves."

They are also the plainest, due to the extreme simplification of their lifestyle. Most keep their heads shaved, wear no jewelry or makeup, and favor plain utilitarian clothing (usually homespun). Ornaments and adornments are scrupulously avoided, but some emblems may be worn or tattooed only if they hold a particular importance and significance."

He cannot later choose a different Attribute. To gain the boost thereafter, the mage performs an instant action to channel his chi, and his Mind dots are added to the chosen Attribute. The effect lasts for up to one hour per activation. Since this is not a spell, the mage could use this attainment at the same time that he casts a Honing the Form spell to gain a truly phenomenal Attribute rating. The one limitation, however, is that the default Duration of any spell that boosts the same Physical Attribute becomes transitory (one turn), even if it is normally prolonged.

				"Text" : "Pygmalion sculpts an image, the perfect Platonic form  of woman. He prays. Through his act of  will, the unliving image becomes the  perfect  living  form.  It’s  a  romantic  conceit.  The  Pygmalian  Society  takes this conceit as a manifesto for  the transformation of the human race,  an allegory for their great work: every  Pygmalian strives to be at once artist,  artwork and animating force. Art  is  at  the  middle  of  everything.  Although  the  Pygmalian   Society’s  members’ styles vary, they agree that art, true art,  Real Art with a capital “A,” becomes a link  to the Supernal World that inspires and alters  the human soul. Real Art creates an  Awakening — a small, temporary  Awakening,  sure  —  but  it’s  an  Awakening.  Art  is  magic.  And  Magic is Art. The Pygmalians believe that Art  is one of the last things that still link  the Sleepers to the Supernal realm.  True  Art  —  great  Art  —  molds  and  shapes  human  history.  Great  Art inspires people. Great Art incites anger. Great Art  provokes action. Every Pygmalian is an artist. The Pygmalians’ magical  attainments  reflect  this.  They  style  themselves  as  the  “Sculptors” of magical reality. They try to imbue every  action, every spell they cast, with meaning. As Pygmalians progress, they become their own greatest Artworks. Pygmalians adopt roles. They take on parts,  deliberately altering their memories, senses and the way  they see things in a search for inspiration — for themselves  and others. The Sculptors remake themselves in their own  image. They act i  their own plays, become the protagonists  of their own stories. Through the creation of Art and themselves as Artworks,  the Pygmalians seek to effect change. An inspired human  soul leads to action, and history takes a new course. These  mages recognized from the very beginning that the power  of Disbelief stops their magic from altering the world in  any but the smallest way, so the Pygmalians work to inspire  and change the minds and souls of Sleepers with the power  to do the same. Through the Pygmalians’ art, they inspire  artists, who in turn have the potential to create something  great. The Pygmalians are muses. They’re propagandists.  They’re agents provocateur. The true Sculptor is obsessed with the future, but lives in  the here and now. A Pygmalian develops the ability to sense  the interplay of time and fate in the lives of the  people around him, experiencin  an intense kind of  synesthesia. He can smell pain, hear joy, taste anger.  The most talented Pygmalians can se  human destinies  laid out before them in tastes and colors. These Pygmalians  sense the weft and weave of destiny  and possibility. Then they embroider  with new potentials for inspiration. They  want to create a path that the Awakened  can travel more easily, at the end of which  lies the Awakening of every man, woman  and child on the planet. The actual medium of the Pygmalians’  Art is open — any art, high or low, can  change things. The Sculptors are obsessed  with finding a Holy Grail of true inspiration that will bring about history changing  art. Charles Dickens wrote a few works of fiction  and ignited Western society’s conscience toward the urban  poor. Renaissance painters invented perspective drawing,  and a mathematics of space that redefined the world. The  writers and translators of the Bible changed the course of  human history many times over. Art  can  be  deadly,  too.  Leni  Riefenstahl  propagated  the sinister glamour that made a nation complicit in the  deaths of millions. China’s official TV and newspapers have  convinced the most populous nation in the world that the  Tiananman Square massacre never happened, that stories of  the massacre are just an American plot. Advertising agencies  use art to relieve people of their money and leave them in  perpetual discontent. Change happens around the Pygmalians. They are not  always the direct cause, but they’re always there, nudging things along. People fall in love. Scientists find new  insights into the nature of things. Revolutions begin, or  end in blood and fire. Whatever the Pygmalians do, they accept no barriers to  their Art. With no boundaries, it’s inevitable that some  Sculptors go bad. These fallen Pygmalians don’t confine  their Art within moral limits. A Pygmalian might commit  atrocities to effect the inspiration of a single individual. A  Pygmalian’s deeds can easily result in dozens of lives ruined  or ended at a single stroke. Love ends more easily than it begins. Even the most noble of revolutions can descend into  tyranny. These ruthless mages give the Pygmalian Society the  bad reputation it currently suffers among the Awakened. True Pygmalians are much more than the terrorists and  instigators  of  chaos  that  other  mages  often  believe  the Sculptors to be. True Pygmalians are artists, and more than that: they think they know the means by which the entire human race can one day Awaken."

				"Title" : "Orders",
				"Text" : "All five of the great mystical orders have Pygmalian  members, but more than half of them of the Sculptors end  up in the Free Council (if they join an order at all). The first  Pygmalians all belonged to the Free Council, and, although  the Legacy is not intimately connected to the order, the line  of tutor to pupil frequently ensures that new Pygmalians join  the Free Council in turn, or belonged to the order in the first  place. The Free Council is certainly the order that is most  amenable to radical social and intellectual change as a means  to  Awaken  humanity.  The  less-regulated  Free  Council  is  also the order most likely to accept a Pygmalian despite the  Legacy’s checkered reputation. The  four  Atlantean  orders  all  have  a  few  Pygmalians.  The Silver Ladder’s stated aim for the Awakening of the  human race attracts a fair number of Sculptors, but these  mages often find themselves frustrated by the order’s strict  and convoluted hierarchy. The Mysterium, with its emphasis on acquiring mystical  knowledge, is fairly accommodating, since the Pygmalians are  often expert at interpreting the past, connecting it to the present and suggesting implications for the future. Mundane and  magical archeology can give the facts about what people did,  but an artist’s insight into human emotions can suggest why. Of the old orders, the Guardians of the Veil and the  Adamantine  Arrow  attract  the  fewest  Sculptors.  The  Guardians don’t generally tolerate the meddling of Pygmalians who try too hard to change human affairs; however,  a few of the more subtle Sculptors do find a home among  the Guardians. Meanwhile, the Arrows sometimes attract  some of the more martially inclined Pygmalians. These  Sculptors are respected by other mages within the order,  but rarely trusted, and it’s often these Pygmalians who fall  into violence as a means of effecting change."

				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "Like Sleeper artists, Pygmalians are as easy to  recognize as they choose to be. Some follow clichés such as the  Galois-smoking bohemian with his beret, straight from the Left  Bank of Paris, or the intellectual sophisticate clad all in basic  black. More Sculptors just look like ordinary, middle-class people.  Their manner gives a truer guide. Whoever Sculptors might  be, they speak and act passionately. Sometimes, they slide into  melodrama that makes cooler-tempered people wince or shake  their heads. Subtler mannerisms and an attention to details of  the Sculptors’ surroundings make Sleepers think the Sculptors  ought to be artists, even if they wear exactly the same clothes  as the people standing next to them."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "Every Pygmalian is an artist with a fair amount  of talent and promise. This includes every possible expression  of art: novelists, painters, poets, performance artists, musicians,  architects, filmmakers, stand-up comedians and DJs are all  represented among the Pygmalians. They are not necessarily  professional artists. Occasionally, an individual who is not  usually considered an artist — a mathematician, a software  developer or even a soldier or a politician — joins the Legacy.  As long as someone considers what she does to be an art, and  is passionate about it, the person is eligible to join. Pygmalians also know their art isn’t enough. Their promise  is unfulfilled, and they all want more. Most Pygmalians are just  talented enough to realize that they’re not quite talented enough  to change the world through their chosen media. They can  never reach the supreme heights attained by a Shakespeare, a  Rembrandt or a Dante. The Pygmalians offer them an alternative through magic, the Ars Mysteriorum itself."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Organization",
				"Text" : "The Pygmalian Society has little or no formal organization. Pygmalians have no central authority and  recognize no precedence other than the respect due teachers  from their pupils. Tutors and pupils seem to find each other  without trying. Training can vary greatly in intensity and style.  One tutor, for example, teaches two or three pupils at a time,  holding regular and highly formal classes, where he imparts the  mystical knowledge of the tradition in a theoretical, academic  form and leaves his pupils to perfect the Legacy’s attainments  in their own time, as “homework.” Another tutor disappears  from her pupil’s life for weeks on end, turning up apparently  according  to  whim.  She  spends  a  few  days  alongside  her  pupil, accompanying the less experienced mage through the  beginning of each new stage, before vanishing again, leaving  the pupil to work out what to do with his new knowledge on  his own. Still another tutor demands that he move into his  pupil’s home, taking over his unfortunate apprentice’s entire  life in order to make a real Sculptor out of her. Whatever the method, all Pygmalian tutors allow their  pupils freedom in their choice of Art form (no matter what  their personal opinions of its validity as a medium might  be). Although it’s common for a tutor to take a pupil who works on the same kind of Art, it’s not universal."

				"Title" : "History",
				"Text" : "The Pygmalian Society has its origins in the Wars of the  Roses, a series of schisms and mystical conflicts between a  number  of  mystical  groups  (particularly  Rosicrucians)  in  19th-century Paris. The conflict seems unthinkable today,  but was widely reported in the Parisian press at the time, since  several well-known people of the day were involved. The factions in the “Wars” were mostly composed of Sleepers. A few  Awakened were also present, indulging their own schisms and  conflicts under cover of the very public and, to them, trivial  arguments of their unwitting Sleeper colleagues. One of these mages was Patrice Cajean. Born penniless in  Brittany in the late 1860s, Cajean Awakened as a teenager into  a nightmare of swirling sounds and colors. By the end of the  1880s, Cajean, through a combination of charm, talent and  Awakened magic, reinvented himself as a figure of urbanity  and wit. He became a popular figure in the bohemian salons  of fin de siècleParis. Through his powers, Cajean was no stranger to the formal  mysticism of the Paris sects. He found himself drawn to one  particular Rosicrucian splinter group. This group declared that  Art was a great mystery, a great empire and a great miracle, and  that Artists were hence the secret kings, priests and magicians  of the world. Cajean wondered if there was something to this  theory. Although he felt contempt for of the importance this  faction attached to its petty squabbles, Cajean investigated the  possibility that Art was in fact a small form of magic, a link  between human beings and the Supernal World (which Cajean,  inspired by Neoplatonist philosophy, identified as the Divine  Principle, or the Godhead). He posited that when God said,  “let there be light,” He created Art through pure inspiration,  distilled into creation by an act of will. Cajean investigated ways to harness this true, inspired  creativity. He believed he could manipulate human history through Art, planting some ideas and stifling others to  weaken the Lie. Just about everyone could appreciate some  sort of Art; so Cajean believed he could Awaken everyone  through this slender thread connecting their souls to the  Supernal World. The project might take a century or more,  but an Acanthus mage is not discouraged by time. A few other mages thought Cajean had a good idea. Cajean  pictured himself as a new Pygmalion, breathing life into the  Fallen World’s lifeless images of the True Forms, so he called  his formal and highly ritualized cabal of like-minded mages the  Pygmalian Society. His magical program for mass Awakening  depended upon communication and control, on ascertaining  the intricate web of connections between the soul and other  souls, between the soul and the past, present and future. To  the Legacy’s existing skill at Fate and Time, the Legacy’s  founders added a deep study of Mind, in order to gain a precise  knowledge of how the arts could manipulate thoughts and  emotions. They had no real plan, though — just a deep faith  in the transformative power of Art. Cajean’s first pupil, Marcus Naismith, was an Englishman.  He brought the Pygmalian Society into the English-speaking world. Naismith’s own take on the Legacy’s magic was  influenced by his great love of the philosophy and art of the  visionary poet and engraver William Blake. English-speak-ing Pygmalians in particular have used Blakean language  to describe their magic and rituals ever since. A member of the Society last saw Patrice Cajean alive in  March of 1916. Right up to the end of his life, Cajean felt  the need to live among the ordinary people he longed to see  reunited with the Godhead. He believed a Supernal inspiration brought the human race to the Great War: patriotic  fervor and the need to prove the courage of nations led the  entire world into a storm of death, plague and famine. Cajean  knew the Great War would shatter the age of European  colonial empires, with possibilities for great Good and terrifying Evil opening up through the rest of the century. The  idealistic mage hoped to avert the horrors of the Great War  and its aftermath, but could not stand to hide in a secure  sanctum far from harm. He needed to share the danger and  the struggle. Cajean failed; he died in the fighting at Verdun,  wearing the face of a man 30 years his junior. In the years after the Great War, the Pygmalian Society fragmented. Without Cajean’s charisma to temper the remaining  founders’ personal quarrels, they drifted apart. Art was changing, too. New movements such as futurism, cubism, and Dada  brought new ideas and new Pygmalians who had little time for  a structured organization. They preferred to use the Legacy in  their own way. By World War II, “Pygmalians” had ceased to  be anything more than a catch-all term for those mages who  crafted their souls in the tradition of Patrice Cajean, and the  Pygmalians have resisted formal organization ever since. Their  methods and Art have changed, but they still hold true to Patrice Cajean’s faith in the Supernal power of Art."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Society and Culture",
				"Text" : "The first principles of the Pygmalian Society grew out of  Western occult traditions. Although most Pygmalians don’t  dress up their magic in the formal principles of Rosicrucian  practice any more, the study of their attainments shows the  influence of a very European style of mysticism, with a special  nod to William Blake. They still use much of Patrice Cajean’s  language. Most Pygmalians still refer to the Supernal as the  “Godhead,”  for  example;  they  call  their  goal  of  universal  Awakening the “Reconciliation,” or the “Marriage of Heaven  and Hell.” As a corollary, most Pygmalians practice European styles  of creative Art. Awakened artists representing non-Western  artistic forms (such as African woodcarving, for example, or  Japanese verse) seldom find their way into the Pygmalian  Society. If such artists-mages do get the opportunity to  join, it’s generally because they try to practice their art in  a Western context; for example, a member of a group of Indian musicians performing in New York state art centers. Apart from the relationship between tutors and their pupils,  Pygmalians aren’t known for working together. They don’t  hold to any network, and they don’t recognize any obligations to each other above and beyond that normally expected  because of membership in a cabal or a mystical order. As Artists, the Pygmalians have more than their fair share  of  self-publicists  in  their  number.  They  tend  to  become  well known among the mystical orders, particularly among  Consilii in Western Europe and in urbanized areas of the  United  States.  Many  more  mages  hear  about  Pygmalian  mages than actually meet them. Unfortunately, the greatest  self-publicists among the Pygmalians are often those who  went wrong. Many mages who know about Pygmalians by  reputation don’t even realize that they’re Artists, and imagine  instead that they are a Legacy of terrorists or lunatics. The wide variation among the methods and styles of the  Pygmalians often means that this assessment goes unchallenged.  Most  Sculptors  don’t  care  in  the  end  what  other  mages think. The nature of the Sculptors’ goal is such that  they care more about the Sleepers, anyway. A Pygmalian mage surrounds herself with Sleepers — talented, passionate people who achieve more than simple talk,  never art-school poseurs. She does her absolute level best to  become a conduit of inspiration for the extraordinary people  around her. At best, a Sculptor tries to drive her companions  to create something special, something fantastic. It’s not the  mage’s own role to change things. No great invention or epochmaking artwork has ever been made by a mage: it’s the way that  the Fallen World works. The Pygmalians recognize that this is  the Sleepers’ world, and the Sleepers have to change it. The credit for great art never belongs to the Sculptor. All  he does is attempt to contribute through magic and other arts  to an environment where genius can flourish; creation can  occur only through inspiration. Simply to give ideas to an  artist is not enough. True genius can work with secondhand  materials (you only need to look at the work of Shakespeare  and Mozart to see that), but great artists transform their  sources in unique, inspired ways. What the Sculptor tries to  do is simply be there and guide his Artists to find the Godhead  themselves. He’s a lover, a companion, a patron, a friend,  sometimes a rival or an enemy. Sometimes, loneliest of all,  he’s an unattainable figure in the distance that haunts his  Artists’ steps. Whatever role he takes, he’s a muse and a  catalyst for the real Artist and the real work. The Pygmalian’s goal is to create the conditions through  which the Reconciliation can happen. Any incursion of  magic, any minor half-Awakening is enough. It doesn’t  matter if there isn’t a specific plan as such. If enough of  these small victories are won, the mages of the Pygmalian  Society are confident that, one day, the Marriage of Heaven  and Hell will take place and everyone will Awaken."

				"Text" : "Art is a dangerous thing. The Pygmalian Society recognizes  this, but, at the same time, the Legacy’s lack of organization  means that the group has no checks and balances. The freedom of its members to find any way at all to create art can  become a trap of Hubris. While fallen Pygmalians have been few, a Sculptor gone wrong can have a terrible influence on  the world around her. These fallen Sculptors are Jonahs. Chaos surrounds them.  When they’re nearby, relationships collapse. Families tear apart.  Cars crash. Crops fail. Diseases break out. Buildings explode. Riots  erupt. Governments lose their grip. Wars start. People die. The most notorious of these Sculptors was Enoch Christopher, a Welsh poet who joined the Pygmalian Society in  1936. Christopher, influenced by the futurists, composed  puzzling  non-linear  works  that,  thanks  to  his  mastery  of  Pygmalian magic, held his manifesto encoded within them:  true inspiration requires conflict. Anger, grief and terror open  artists to Supernal truth and goad them to the heights of  self-expression. Christopher believed that if his Art was to  have any chance of bringing about real transformation, the  Art had to be unfettered by any limits of scale or morality. This manifesto of change through violence has cropped  up, quite independently, on a number of occasions. These  Pygmalians might not openly say so to begin with, but they  share the assumption that human beings are just raw clay for  the Sculptor’s Art. Some Sculptors begin to directly manipulate lives. The more powerful among them tear up human  memories and put them back together like a Burroughsian  cut-up, using trauma to drive their victims to action. Some Pygmalians become equally cavalier with themselves. They alter their own minds, messing with everything  from taste in clothes right through to sexual orientation,  even temporarily rebuilding their own memories in order  to becometheir grand Artwork and, through the inspiration  they gain, alter the world. It’s not healthy to become close  to Pygmalians who works like this. Everything goes wrong  around them, as they engineer conflict in their own lives. They  manipulate people around them to create lovers, enemies,  tragedies,  accidents  and  obstacles  to  overcome  —  often  without even informing themselves that they’re doing it.  For instance, a Sculptor creates an alternate personality to  fall in love, then the master personality kills the lover so  the other self can experience true loss. Enoch Christopher himself died in the late 1980s, a notorious harbinger of disaster. He had become possibly the  best-known Pygmalian who had ever lived, almost singlehandedly responsible for the Pygmalian Society’s bad name.  The original manuscript copy of Christopher’s 1939 collection of “automatic poetry,” When I Came Back It Was Gone,  still exists and is a powerful, spontaneously generated Artifact  in its own right. The revisions and alterations contained in this sheaf of yellowing paper hold frightening secrets and great power along with cold, brutal resonance."

				"Title" : "Induction",
				"Text" : "The Pygmalian Society sets few requirements for its members. Pygmalians are Awakened and Artists. All have that  desire, that need, to make a powerful difference to creation.  The Pygmalians have no hard rules for choosing their pupils.  Some Pygmalians seek particular individuals; others wait for pupils  to come to them. Time seems to play tricks on new Pygmalians,  and many even experience their first initiation before deciding  to join the order, or even knowing that they’re being initiated  — which is just as well, since, given the Legacy’s terrible reputation, very few mages would actually join without some kind of  revelation as to what the Pygmalian Society really is. In his induction, the mage enters a deep coma. Initiation  plays out as a hyper-real dream in which the mage, placed in the  surroundings of his mind’s eye, is forced to undergo an ordeal  of some kind. Ordeals vary, but they are always deadly serious,  and sometimes just deadly: the new Pygmalian might have to  endure what seems like a week-long ritual dance, survive a  crucifixion or experience being tattooed all over his body. In  the ordeal, the Pygmalian is guided or hindered (or both) by  a visionary figure who will return in each of the Pygmalian’s  initiatory ordeals. Sometimes, this figure is a mirror image of  the Pygmalian, a past self or a potential future self. Sometimes,  the guide is a sexual complement of the Pygmalian, a perfect  “other half” of the opposite gender to the initiate (or, if the  initiate is gay, the same gender). Sometimes, the guide is an  entirely different figure, perhaps one of the regular cast of the  initiate’s  dreams  elevated  to  the  position  of  spokesperson.  Sometimes, the guide is a mythical or literary figure: anything  from a Grail-questing knight to a talking animal that leads the  mage down a rabbit hole. When  the  ordeal  is  over,  the  Pygmalian  returns  to  consciousness and the real world. There is always some  anomaly that suggests that the ordeal was not a dream. A  Pygmalian who endures being tattooed wakes up with a small  tattoo on her face. A Pygmalian who endures crucifixion  in his vision wakes up with small scars on his hands, feet  and sides. Another Pygmalian finds small objects or items  of jewellery belonging to her mage’s guide in her pockets.  On the other hand, a Pygmalian who fails his initiation  usually has no memory of what happened, and is likely to be found very ill, or with broken bones or just covered from  head-to-toe with bruises or superficial burns. Although every Pygmalian tutor teaches his pupils in his  own way, the substance of the teaching is fairly constant: pupils  are taught the Pygmalian philosophy of Art. At the same time,  Pygmalian pupils receive absolute freedom with what they do  with the teaching, how they express their Art and whom they  choose to guide in turn. In each subsequent initiation, the Pygmalian undergoes  another hallucinatory ordeal, and, each time, gains another  sign that the ordeal was more than simply a dream. These  dream-ordeals, however, are not spontaneous unless the Sculptor has cut her tie to her tutor and decided to craft her soul  without further help. Soulcrafting for the second and third  attainments involves a preparatory ritual. Each tutor and pupil  design a unique ritual to induce the initiatory vision, but the  ceremony uses paraphernalia drawn from Western magical  traditions. Depending on the tutor, this could involve robes  or nakedness, magic circles, wands, knives and the like. Shortly before Cajean’s death, he underwent a fourth ordeal.  He told one of his pupils that he had learned the truth about  where these visions came from and who the visionary figures  really are. He died before he could lead anyone else to the  fourth attainment. If any other Pygmalians have reached the  fourth ordeal by themselves, they’ve kept quiet about what  they learned."

That’s only partly accurate: Acanthus mages take  a free and easy view of Time, but even they don’t  engage in rampant causality violation. Unconsciously, an Acanthus mage’s soul can see  the possible futures and the option of joining the Pygmalians. The soul induces the initiatory coma; mind  and soul have their dialogue and reach a conclusion.  The soulcrafting is not complete, however. Unless the  nascent Pygmalian has a Gnosis of 4 or higher, he still  needs a tutor’s help to “lock in” his soul’s new shape. "

				"Description" : "The first thing the aspiring Pygmalian learns is how to  direct emotions through the manipulation of human senses.  Smells,  sounds,  tastes  and  colors  —  or  their  implanted  memories  —  can  alter  someone’s  mood  for  good  or  ill,  reminding a subject or a group of people of whatever emotion the mage wants them to experience. This attainment  produces an effect more or less identical to the Mind 2 rote  “Sculpt the Heart” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 208),  but using a contested roll of Manipulation + Expression +  Mind versus the subject’s Composure + Gnosis. The mage’s own senses are affected too. By examining  the  sensory  reflection  of  the  emotions  dredged  up  from  his subjects’ memories, the mage can perceive the weave  of connections existing between the people he affects and  the people around them. The links of emotion and Fate  manifest as a kind of synesthesia, with emotional smells,  tastes, sounds or colors becoming apparent to the mage as he  examines the web of association around him. In game terms,  this works as the Fate 1 spell “Interconnections” (see Mage:  The Awakening, p. 148). As a minor side effect, the mage  permanently becomes a synesthete, with tastes, colors, smells  and sounds mixed up in his perceptions. Many Pygmalians  see this as a benefit, citing Shakespeare and Kandinsky as  examples of inspiration through synesthesia. The mage can bring about the memory of feeling through  simple conversation, or through the medium of his Art (for  example, by means of a musical performance, a stand-up  gig or a gallery showing at which the mage is present). The  effect does not always have to be direct. Calming words can,  for example, be used to hide an infuriating subtext (in the  manner of a “friends, Romans, countrymen” speech). If  they  can,  Pygmalians  use  this  power  on  groups  of  people rather than individuals, since the more people the  Pygmalians can affect, the more information they can glean  about their interconnections. Sometimes, a Pygmalian uses this power on herself. She  might feel she needs to force herself to do something frightening or emotionally painful. She might want to make herself  play a role with true sincerity, or she could simply want to  feel something. Even though the mage uses this power on a  willing subject (i.e., herself), she still makes a reflexive roll  of Composure + Gnosis to resist; the mage might be willing,  but, subconsciously, her soul perceives this as an intrusion and  fights back. The mage can, however, reduce her resistance  dice pool by spending Mana, thus suppressing her natural reactions with magical brute force: each point of Mana spent reduces the Composure + Gnosis pool by 1."

				"Description" : "The Pygmalians develop their understanding of sensory  and emotional manipulation further by learning how to  imbue their actions or their performances with complex  meaning.  This  works  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  Mind  3  rote  “Bricks  of  Babel”  (see Mage:  The  Awakening,  p. 213), but using a roll of Intelligence + Expression +  Mind.  Pygmalians  who  achieve  this  second  attainment  can  communicate  complex  concepts  and  messages  in  a  few brief, insignificant movements, or say one thing and  communicate something completely different to the recipient. The mage can choose whether to communicate his  message to an individual or to a group (use the modifiers  for casting spells on more than one target; see Mage: The  Awakening p. 118); the mage can also choose whether  the recipients of the message actually realize that they’ve  received a message from him, rather than simply having  thoughts pop into their heads. The second attainment can be used in conjunction with  the first. After succeeding with an application of Arrows of  Desire, the mage’s player makes another roll to apply the first  attainment to the message. If the roll is successful, the message  has the added effect of affecting the recipient’s emotions. A skillful and lucky Pygmalian who uses the second attainment  and the first in quick succession can move crowds of people to  believe nearly anything. However, these attainments do not work over radio, television or recorded media — the Sculptor  must be “live and in person.” Optional Arcanum: Time 3 Pygmalians  realize  that  they  often  make  mistakes,  and  that sometimes brushstrokes need to be erased or altered.  Sometimes, a Pygmalian needs to know the immediate results of two or three choices. A Pygmalian mage who is also  a Disciple of Time can fold herself into her own short-term  memory, bodily pulling herself moments into the past in the  same way as the Time 3 spell, “Shifting Sands” (see Mage:  The Awakening, p. 263). A Pygmalian knowing this spell or ancillary attainment  often repeats it, over and over, as he examines all the possible results of his decisions. This can be dangerous, since,  similar to the “Shifting Sands” spell, anything that happens  to the mage still happens, because the mage, in going back,  actually displaces his earlier self from the timestream. Sculptors  who  do  this  often  may  experience  strange  sensations  at  entirely  random  intervals,  shuddery,  cold sort of feelings, like sudden flashbacks of dying."

				"Description" : "Pygmalians who reach the third attainment find that, while  the secret of inspiration is still, frustratingly, just out of their  grasp, they can, at the very least, produce the conditions for  revelation to happen. Through the manipulation of memory, a  mage with this attainment can make a single subject experience  an epiphany, a sudden understanding of some past event, or a  false memory of some inspirational, life-changing experience.  Depending on the event the mage chooses, this experience  can be healing or traumatic. In game terms, this works like the  Mind 4 spell “Breach the Vault of Memory” (see Mage: The  Awakening, p. 214) with the same contested roll of Gnosis  + Mind versus the subject’s Resolve + Gnosis. The revelation doesn’t last very long (usually no more than  a scene — see the spell description in Mage: The Awakening,  then apply the number of successes rolled to the Extended  Spellcasting Duration chart for prolonged spells on p. 120 of  that book), but the revelation’s indirect effects last. Even when  the subject recognizes that her memories of love, divine revelation or childhood trauma were delusions, she still recalls what  it felt like to remember these things. The memory of feeling is  not feeling, but often is enough to drive a creative individual  to cathartic action. A novelist given a taste of bitter love  writes a powerful story of loss and desire. A painter is driven  to a masterpiece by the memory of a unique face. Pygmalians often bolster the effect, repeating it or prolonging it with the use of the first and second attainments.  Pygmalians also use this power on themselves. Again, a  Sculptor might want believe utterly in his adopted role or  experience someone else’s trauma, or even to experience  that madness said to be close to genius. Similar to the first  attainment, a Pygmalian using this power on himself still  has to make a reflexive resistance roll, this time Resolve + Gnosis (per “Breach the Vault of Memory”). He can spend  Mana to force the power on himself. Pygmalians using this  power often have no idea what they’re doing when under  their own influence. Some Pygmalians can even take on  three entirely separate roles in a day, all the time unaware  of the actions of their other selves. Optional Arcanum: Time 4 An Adept of Time who achieves the power to impart Eternity  in an Hour gains a small revelation of his own. By examining  the skeins of fate and time connecting everything, the Pygmalian  can discern what needs to happen in order for any individual to  create history, or True Art — or stop it from happening. This  works exactly like the Time 4 spell, “Prophecy” (see Mage: The  Awakening, p. 264). The answer is never direct. It comes as a feeling, an emotion, supplemented by synesthetic sensory experiences (heard  colors, tasted sounds). The mage, thinking over the options,  suddenly knows what feelsright, and takes the opportunity  to act on that intuition."

				"Text" : "Every mage must reach across the Abyss to grasp Supernal power. This is no mere initiatic hurdle to weed out the unworthy, but a very real danger to a mage’s psyche, for the Abyss is far from empty. Awash in its torrents, its darkness clings, permeating clothing, body and soul. The slightest misstep in the Abyss can so derange the enlightened that any illumination they transmit is tainted with madness. Thus do the Legacies collectively known as the Scelesti —the Accursed —come into being. If the hordes of the Abyss can be said to have an agenda or motive, it would seem to be a desire to claim the Fallen World in lieu of the shining realms of the Supernal World that are closed to them. These entities, languishing in a kind of non-existence between the pure light of the Supernal and the gross matter of the Fallen World, seek to establish themselves in the latter. To accomplish this, an Abyssal entity must have some instrument through which to work its will in the material world. The Scelesti are such instruments. Unable to emerge in being by their own power alone, Abyssal beings must first make themselves known to an Awakened consciousness, who can then make their presence real in the Fallen World by writing the spirits’unpronounceable names across the earth in letters of fear, suffering and disaster. Mages who gaze too long into the Abyss fall prey to fascination and awe, their souls bound up in madness and obsession with the yawning chasms of unreason. Some might escape with psychic scars. Others fall prey to their own delusions and desires. Mistaking the vastness of the Abyss for a source of knowledge and strength, they abandon all sense and reason to lose themselves in endless chaos. Or they pledge themselves to the entities that lurk therein, and so consign their souls to oblivion. Those who are able to retain enough of their identity to contain their madness find that the Abyss has power in and of itself, apart from the hordes of non-beings that haunt it. Some swim in a primordial ocean of chaosplasm, riding its currents and shaping it to their ends. Others are lost to the void, their inner light swallowed in darkness and silence. Still others may find twisted reflections of their Supernal ideals in delusions. Meanwhile, the new overlords of the corrupted mages goad them on with promises of worldly glory and opulence —once the Fallen World has fallen into their clutches, of course. Such a thing cannot be accomplished alone, however, so the immediate task of the Scelesti becomes that of luring other mages into their sway and bringing them to the brink of the Abyss. Being one of the Accursed has its advantages. In a corrupt world, the expert corrupter can rule. The Abyssal hordes are not without power, and grant portions of their might to a mage who can provide them with a foothold in the Fallen World. And there are legions of lesser entities, any of which may be dispatched to serve a Scelestus as slave, guardian or familiar. Damnation by this magical course is not specific to any Path. Inheritors of this Legacy may be found practicing anywhere in mage society, using arcane symbolism and hermetic secrecy to conceal their true nature from peers and the rest of the world. Sometimes when a Scelestus is discovered within an order, his entire tutorial lineage may be stricken from the order’s records if it cannot be determined at which point a teacher was corrupted. (Hence, the Scelesti are also sometimes called Nefandi, the Unutterable, or “that which is not to be spoken of.”)"

The Abyss is not entirely without its own internal “politics,” however, with alliances and enmities forming between its most powerful entities.

Before the circle is complete, the mage must demarcate its outmost boundaries. The most common method is to scrape a piece of chalk or marker in a dash along each of the four cardinal directions, although the mage could just as easily place coins, empty coffee cups or soda cans, or even dirt if he doesn’t want to be too obvious about doing something arcane. Once established, the circle lasts for up to one hour. If two or more of the four markers are moved or erased, the effect is canceled until the circle is established again.

				"Text" : "What  makes  humanity  special?  Is  it  the  capacity  to Awaken?  Such  a  view  is  arrogant  in  the  extreme,  say the Sphinxes, for to look at the Sleepers as inferior is to ignore one’s own humanity. No, to the mages who choose to follow this Legacy, the true magic of humanity is language. More to the point, it is the capacity for symbolic recognition, to see a gesture or a marking, hear a collection of sounds, and from that understand. Human beings are optimized, either by the design of a greater being or the rigors of evolution, toward speech and language, both anatomically and neurologically. But all of the biophysical adaptations of the human body toward speech mean nothing without the ability to understand symbols. Upon this phenomenon (some would say “miracle”), the Legacy of the Sphinx is based. Walking the path of the Sphinx is an exercise in abstraction, for the Legacy teaches understanding without processing, learning truth without realizing fact.  A  Sphinx  sees  meaning  everywhere  —  in  the number of cracks in a sidewalk, in the seemingly random sounds from a baby’s babbling, in the texture of a brick wall. Intrinsic in this ability to find meaning anywhere is the knowledge that this meaning comes from somewhere. Sphinxes who cleave to the Atlantean model of mystical understanding posit that this meaning might come from ancient masters sending information forward in time, in a much more subtle way than with the ananke (see p. 330 of Mage: The Awakening). Those who do not follow the orders of the Pentacle — and even some who do — believe that this truth comes directly from the Supernal Realms. The name “Sphinx,” of course, comes from the mythological creature that Oedipus confronted near Thebes. He solved the riddle of the Sphinx, and she leaped to her death in horror that her secret was revealed. Whether the name “Sphinx” was one that members of this Legacy originally applied to themselves or not, they do not see themselves as jealous keepers of secrets. Indeed, they tend to view themselves as searchers trying to solve a riddle. That riddle is difficult to express, because it is so vast in scope, but the basic idea is this: If meaning can be found in anything, at any level of understanding or consciousness, then  what  is  the  ultimate  meaning?  Where  does  the  truth come from, and to what purpose?"
			}, {
				"Title" : "Orders",
				"Text" : "While any  Mastigos can  become  a  Sphinx, the  Legacy’s  membership  is  primarily  drawn  from  the  Mysterium. The order’s predilection for finding, analyzing and  cataloguing knowledge, combined with the fact that the  Mysterium often encounters information too  dangerous to be read and understood by an  untrained mage, points members of all Paths  toward the Legacy.  Outside of the Mysterium, the order that claims  the largest number of Pathfinders is unquestionably the  Guardians of the Veil. Sphinxes are by nature superlative ciphers, capable of breaking almost any code  or circumventing any puzzle, given enough time.  The Guardians thus appreciate their ability to  weave  symbols  and  hidden  messages,  both  true and misleading, into the secret societies  and fronts that the order sets up. In fact, it  isn’t  uncommon  for  an  Epopt  to  be  a  Sphinx  herself or at least work with one. It’s easy for even the  Guardians themselves to become lost in the morass of  conflicting symbolism and double-blind codes, and a Sphinx  makes a good “skeleton key” when quick understanding and  interpretation are necessary. Warlocks of other orders do find their way to the Legacy as  well, of course. Sphinxes of the Adamantine Arrow tend to  use their ability to find meaning and truth in the mundane  as  a  way  to  avoid  danger  and  protect  those  around  them.  Pathfinders in the Free Council stay on the cutting edge of  linguistic  theory  and  language  development,  searching  for  ways  to  expand  people’s  understanding  of  each  other  and  themselves. The Silver Ladder’s few Sphinxes often believe  that the Ladder is the best way to recreate some of the conditions in lost Atlantis, and thus come closer to the secrets and messages that the ancients held."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "Sphinxes might come from any walk of life. The  Legacy is not culturally based, and so doesn’t dictate a lifestyle  or a given mode of dress. Most Sphinxes are contemplative  and observant, and many are easily distracted, staring for long  minutes at patterns of texture or light as they try to interpret  them. Pathfinders also tend to be good listeners and remain  open to communication with others. Thus, Pathfinders go out of their way to appear non-threatening and available."

Some are computer  programmers working with code; others are teachers or speech  pathologists attempting to help others communicate. Some  don’t come from a background relating to communication at  all, but feel that the universe has a greater meaning that needs  to be deciphered.  Mastigos who choose this Legacy are often struck by the cacophony of Pandemonium during their Awakenings, and wish to interpret the ranting and screaming of the demons found there."

Small radio stations, public access television shows, magazine  articles, books and, of course, Internet sites, all serve as bulletin  boards for the Legacy. The messages are all heavily coded and  require time and effort to encode or decode, but the wealth of  knowledge that a Sphinx of the order can draw upon is great. Outside the order, Pathfinders have little  in the way of formal contact, though  when they encounter each other the  meeting is usually friendly.  The relationship between mentor  and student varies. Since the training requires so much intuition and  comparatively  little  actual  study,  some  students  come  to  resent  their  mentors,  feeling  that  they  are  deliberately  keeping  secrets  and knowledge from the students.  Others  (typically  those  who  go  on  to become successful as Sphinxes)  recognize that the philosophy and  wisdom of the Legacy is extremely  difficult  to  teach,  and  respect their  mentors  all  the  more because of it."

The greatest secrets of the Supernal  Realms were fractured, shards of power and knowledge spread  out among the mages of the world. Without the Island of the  Magi’s society to compile the knowledge, the Awakened had  to work alone or in small cabals, never knowing enough of  the truth to recapture their past glories.  The Sphinx Legacy arose from the frustration of those mages.  The Mastigos of the time knew that with the application of the  Mind Arcanum they could comprehend any earthly language,  but  that  wasn’t  enough.  Language  wasn’t  the  true  barrier,  these mages discovered, because a language is merely a set of  symbols. These primordial Sphinxes realized that inherent in  the process of making symbols lay the solution to the confusion caused by the destruction of the Celestial Ladder — that  they could look beyond graphemes and sounds and simply  communicate with pure meaning.  Modern-day  Sphinxes  sometimes  claim  that  the  Legacy  was an important part of the formation of the Mysterium,  and  that  might  well  be  true. Whether or  not this was the  case, the Sphinx  Legacy  became,  over time, the province of  the  Wings  of  the  Dragon  almost  exclusively.  While  a  lone  Mastigos  might occasionally discover and follow the Legacy, the order guarded its  secrets jealously.  Something as basic to humanity  as the quest for communication  and language, however, wasn’t  going to remain under lock  and key forever."
			}, {
				"Title" : "The De Velasco Resurgence",
				"Text" : "The  first  reliably  recorded  instance  of  a  mage  outside  the  Mysterium joining  the Legacy came  in 1575 or so,  in  a  book  written  by  a Spanish nobleman (and Mastigos) named Juan de Velasco. De  Velasco had observed his two young cousins, who were both  born deaf, being tutored by a Benedictine monk named Pedro  Ponce de Léon. Classical opinions on the deaf stated that they  had very little education potential and that they could never  learn to speak (if deafness occurred pre-lingually). Ponce de Léon,  himself a Sleeper, challenged that opinion, and taught the de  Velasco brothers not only to read and write, but to speak three  different languages. He did not, however, record his methods,  and so history would have to wait for widespread methods of  educating the deaf, but Juan de Velasco watched his cousins’  lessons with interest. He was less interested in teaching deaf  people than in the conveyance of meaning in non-verbal ways.  He wrote several treatises on the topic for his Consilium, the  most famous of which was titled “The Art and Science of the  Recognition of Meaning.” In that document, he detailed how he  was able to send coded messages through paintings and divine  the immediate future by listening to hymns at Mass (as later  mages have pointed out, de Velasco probably wasn’t reading the  future per se; rather, he was reading probability).  De Velasco’s writings have been translated into many different  languages over the years, although modern Sphinxes have found  that reading them in their original Latin yields layers of meaning far beyond the simple message of the words. The Mysterium  currently holds most of these documents, but de Velasco was a  prolific writer and painter, and historians the world over might  unknowingly hold either one of his esoteric writings or hauntingly  beautiful paintings. Either type of work might actually be a road  map to a rote, an Atlantean temple or some other worthy goal. De Velasco left no record behind of a pupil, but it is widely  accepted that de Velasco passed his learning along to another  Mastigos. Whether this pupil was a member of the Mysterium  or not is a debated issue; the order claims that he was, while  members of all of the other orders also claim him (and often  have records that seem to support their claims). The Mysterium has history on its side, of course, but after de Velasco the  Legacy became available to any mage of the order who wished  to become a Pathfinder. Since then, the Mysterium has tried  to project the image that they created the Legacy in the first  place. Even so, the Legacy remains the province of the Warlocks  just as much as that of the Alae Draconis. Other than de Velasco, history has not produced famous  Sphinxes. The Pathfinders tend to be inscrutable and unobtrusive, even by Awakened standards, and, of course, any mage  who achieved mastery of the Legacy’s Attainments would be  exceptionally difficult to find in any record (see the Off the  Path Attainment, below). The Mysterium, true to form, tries  to keep records of the members of the order who have gone on  to become Pathfinders, but the Sphinxes themselves often alter  such records, leaving behind only obtuse riddles that, properly  interpreted, might lead to the mage in question."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Society and Culture",
				"Text" : "Because so much of the Sphinx mindset and activity relies  on observation rather than direct action, mages outside of the  Mysterium don’t often know much about the Legacy. What  they do know tends to depend on who they hear it from or  the particular Sphinx they’ve encountered. Some Sphinxes  are infuriatingly cryptic, either because they genuinely enjoy  lording their uncanny insight over others or because they are  inundated with so much information that they fear to reveal  too much or too little. Other Sphinxes are happy to share what  they know, but are well aware that their information tends to  be true, but lacking in context. Consider: A Sphinx can read a  thick book in an ancient language in an hour and understand  all of the information it contains, but he will be hard-pressed  to convey the nuances and intricacies of the information. His  rendition of the information resembles a quick summary, and  this leaves listeners to wonder about its accuracy. Indeed, it’s  not uncommon for non-Sphinxes to assume that a Pathfinder  is using some kind of fortune-telling method to glean the information, and such methods (often based on Time or Space  magic) aren’t often completely accurate. The Sphinxes protest  this, saying that their methods rely on direct observation rather  than symbolic guesswork, but because those methods are based  largely on intuition that non-Sphinxes do not possess these  protests often go unheard. In the end, many Pathfinders find  it easiest not to advertise their membership in the Legacy and  to offer help and advice only when it is requested. Of course,  that sometimes results in other mages labeling them reclusive  and unhelpful, but an experienced Pathfinder has long since  given up on pleasing all the people all the time.  The culture of the Sphinx Legacy is one of research, academia  and intuition. Sphinxes aren’t necessarily impulsive, but they  do tend to be easily distracted, and mentors of the Legacy encourage Pathfinders to follow clues that they see in the hidden  patterns of the world. This leads Sphinxes to cross paths with  cabals of mages and even stranger inhabitants of the World of  Darkness, and so members of the Legacy tend to be skilled at  either diplomacy or flight (or, more rarely, defensive combat).  Among the Awakened, Sphinxes try to become well-versed in  which cabal holds influence in what area and who the local  movers  and  shakers  of  the  Consilium  are,  just  in  case  the  Sphinxes need to name-drop to justify trespassing. Their skill  in dealing with people grants them a great deal of latitude in  such situations, and so Sphinxes often occupy positions in a  Consilium such as Herald or Councilor.  In the Mysterium, the Sphinx takes up the role of guardian,  much like his namesake. Sphinxes don’t ask riddles of seekers, but they also don’t give information out to just anyone.  This isn’t due to a perception that others aren’t worthy of the  knowledge (usually), but rather that the knowledge in question  might be dangerous. Sphinxes can absorb information without  attracting its attention, learning by observation of patterns  rather than direct reading and study. As such, a Sphinx might  administer a coded test to a mage seeking a book or fact that  the Sphinx considers risky. If the mage has the patience and  skill to decipher it, the Sphinx considers it safe to grant the  mage what he seeks. This role, of course, is the very definition of a thankless task, since it brands the Sphinx as a stingy  distributor of knowledge. Even so, it is a role for which the Pathfinders are uniquely suited, and so members of the Legacy  who belong to the Mysterium often become Censors.  The Legacy’s overarching philosophy — that the universe  has meaning and that this meaning was put in place deliberately — doesn’t actually see much discussion among Sphinxes  unless one of them has made a breakthrough. New members  of the Legacy often hear the theory on the matter that their  tutors espouse, and pick up more as they interact with other  Pathfinders. Most Sphinxes have preconceived notions about  the nature of the meaning of the universe. Popular hypotheses  include the following: • God: Regardless what religion or faith the Sphinx espouses,  the notion of a Divine creator (or at least organizer) is almost  as popular among mages as among Sleepers. The fact that no  explanation of Atlantis, the Fall, the Celestial Ladder or the  Supernal  Realms  actually  contradicts  this  belief  is  helpful.  Theist Sphinxes believe that the messages they see in everyday  patterns are God’s communication with Earth, and that the  language of pure meaning is the true divine language.  • Oracles: Sphinxes with a more magic-centered view of  the world believe that the Oracles, the secret masters trapped  in the Supernal Realms during the collapse of the Celestial  Ladder, manipulate events and patterns so subtly that these  machinations are virtually unnoticeable unless one is specifically looking. These Sphinxes claim that, with rare exceptions  (such as the ananke), the Oracles cannot communicate directly,  as  the  Abyss  thwarts  them.  Only  by  nudging  the  world  in  imperceptible ways — causing a flock of  birds to take flight at the right second,  a gust of wind that alters the direction  of raindrops, and so on — can they send  their messages. Of course, if the Oracles  can  do  this,  the  Sphinxes  sometimes  wonder, what stops the Exarchs from  doing so as well? The answer is: nothing,  and the Seers of the Throne boast their  share of Pathfinders.  • The Supernal Realms: Although the  Sphinx  Legacy  belongs  as  much  to  the  Warlocks as to the Mysterium, comparatively  few Mastigos espouse this particular theory  to explain the origin of the messages in the  world. Those who do are quite different  from the usual contemplative and observant  Pathfinders  —  such  Mastigos  tend  to  be  fearful and paranoid. Some Sphinxes believe  that the denizens of the Supernal Realms are  responsible for the informative patterns that  the Sphinxes so diligently analyze. These denizens might not even be creating these patterns  deliberately, the mages say, but the Fallen World  reflects the Supernal Realms. Therefore, the true  nature of reality comes through in everything the  world has to offer, regardless of whether Sleepers (or  even most of the Awakened) are prepared to look for it.  Of course, the implications of the inhabitants of Pandemonium  leaving hints for mages to find are troubling, to say the least.  This, perhaps, is why this theory has more adherents among  Mysterium Sphinxes of other Paths. The notion that the patterns  are the inhuman whispers of demons is profoundly disquieting.  No matter which Supernal Realm the patterns originate from,  though (and it would make more sense to assume that allof  them have some input), their natives are inscrutable and largely  unknowable by human standards, yet certainly not all-powerful.  Is there a greater design above even the mysterious clues left in random patterns of wind, ink and brick?"
			}, {
				"Title" : "Induction",
				"Text" : "Prospective Sphinxes often begin their training for the Legacy  before they know it exists. Inquisitive and persistent, they pay  close attention to the world around them, searching for an  overlying meaning. Chaos theory, fractal theory and even the  “theory” of intelligent design have produced students of the  right mindset to become Pathfinders. If a mage looks deeply  enough into the right patterns, using the right methods, he  might receive a flash of insight that allows him to break a message coded with the Hidden Meaning Attainment. Alternately,  his studies might just lead him to a mage already known for  the same kind of research. In any case, sooner or later the  prospective Sphinx finds a Sphinx. Presuming  that  the  Sphinx  that  the  prospective  member  finds  is  willing  and  able  to  take  on  a  pupil,  and  that  the chemistry between the two mages is of the right sort to permit  such a relationship, the tutor typically inundates the student  with coded messages. At first, the mage simply uses mundane  codes, starting with simple alphabetical ciphers and moving up  to complex encryption. The mage doesn’t need to learn how  to break all of these codes, and certainly isn’t forbidden from  using magic in his attempt. The important lesson here is to  look beyond letters, numbers and words and see meaning in  markings, sounds and patterns. This kind of approach isn’t easy  to teach, as it relies more on intuition than process, and some  mages simply aren’t up to the task. The tutor watches carefully  to see if his student is capable of learning what the tutor is  presenting, of seeing a meaning greater than the message. If  so, they can begin the process of soulcrafting. If not, the tutor  gently (or not-so-gently, depending on the mage in question)  suggests that the student might find what he seeks elsewhere.  In the Mysterium, the process works a little differently. Mages  who show a predilection for puzzles, ciphers and language are  often told about the Legacy in a roundabout fashion (so as to  avoid making it seem as though membership in a Legacy is  being offered or suggested). A mage who is a good candidate  for becoming a Pathfinder will pursue information about the  Legacy, or so goes the theory. Once word gets out in a given  Consilium’s  Mysterium  cabal(s)  that  a  mage  wants  to  join  the Legacy, the network becomes activated and the mage’s  accomplishments, history, faults and foibles are made known  to any Sphinx who bothers to check. If the mage is a good fit  for the Legacy, a tutor arranges to travel to the student or have  the student brought to him for training. In either case, the stages of soulcrafting don’t require much  in the way of ceremony. Once a mage has reached the required  level of power, his tutor assists him in delving deeper into the  mysteries of the world’s wisdom. This is normally accompanied  by several days of study, questioning and observation of whatever phenomena the mentor feels hold the wisdom the student  needs in order to progress. Some tutors hole their students up  in libraries preceding a new Attainment, others immerse their  charges in as much sensation as possible in order to force the  student to focus on one pattern at a time. Tutors, whatever their methods, watch their students for  signs of madness at all times. When everything around a mage  is significant, when nothingis coincidence or meaningless, he  can feel paralyzed and helpless, afraid to do anything for fear  of offsetting some cosmic balance. Alternately, some Sphinxes  become drunk with the power and knowledge they possess,  striving to learn as much as they can to exert maximum possible influence in the world. Either of these eventualities is  cause for alarm to the tutor, because they distract the student  from his quest to learn the origin of meaning. A Sphinx who  degenerates too much or too quickly in Wisdom might find  himself  placed  in  an  oubliette,  magically  deprived  of  any  sensation whatsoever. It is believed that, in this kind of environment with no patterns from which to derive information,  that a mad Sphinx can find himself again and regain his sanity.  This doesn’t always work, of course; sometimes the madness  just intensifies, but the oubliette is the best the Legacy can do to help. The alternative is to remove the mage’s ability to  see the world’s meaning permanently, and the only way to do  that is to kill him."

		"AttainmentDescription" : "The Attainments of the Sphinx are, for the most part, perceptive in nature rather than proactive. To the Pathfinders, the  important and most difficult part of problem-solving is gaining  the knowledge required to solve it. Alexander’s brutish solution  to the Gordian Knot repulses them, because it sends the message that brute force can replace patience and understanding.  Destructive magic can be countered, manipulative magic can  be redirected, but magic that hides knowledge cannot stop a persistent and intelligent willworker.",

				"Description" : "The Sphinx’s first Attainment allows her to find and decipher  wisdom in the mundane. Anything that has a pattern can be  used for this purpose, be it cracks in the ceiling or the calls of  a flock of birds. The mage merely needs to study the pattern  for a few seconds to gain the information contained therein.  The effect is similar to the Fate 1 “Interconnections” spell  (see p. 148 of Mage: The Awakening), except that the Attainment requires only an instant action and bestows information  as though the mage had achieved five successes on the roll.  Sphinxes, therefore, are awash in information if they stop to  consider it, able to see connections, however faint, between  any objects, people or places in sight. In addition to see these  sympathetic connections, a Sphinx can use this Attainment to  solve puzzles and riddles, since she can see the patterns behind  their creation. Sphinx characters with this Attainment receive  a +3 modifier to all Mental rolls involving riddles, puzzles,  mazes or other such conundrums.  A  more  common  use  of  this  Attainment,  however,  is  its  ability to hide meaning within seemingly random patterns. A  Sphinx can use Hidden Meaning to write (or draw or record) a  message in a code that no Sleeper cipher can crack. The mage  must physically create the message, either by writing a seemingly innocuous letter, drawing a picture or any other method  she prefers. The player rolls Manipulation + Investigation or  Academics to encrypt the message. When another mage with  this Attainment tries to decipher the code, her player must make  an extended Intelligence + Investigation roll to do so, with a  number of required successes equal to [5 x the successes on the  encryption roll]. Again, each roll requires an hour of deciphering. The encoding mage may choose to forego her roll, meaning  that any Sphinx can decode the message automatically.  A mage with Fate 2 can also attempt to uncover the meaning  in the message. First she must be aware that the underlying  meaning exists, which is by itself difficult (she might be tipped  off by an ally, a hunch or even the Dream Merit). She then  casts an improvised and extended Fate 2 spell, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x encoder’s successes,  minimum of five].  Optional Arcanum: Mind 2 A Sphinx who has studied the Arcanum of Mind can use her  knowledge of the patterns and intrinsic meaning to aid her in  interactions with others. By studying a person’s movements, the  subtle messages conveyed by facial expression, body language  and breathing and even how others react to him, the Sphinx  gains an advantage in dealing with him. This effect is similar  to the Mind 2 “First Impressions” spell (see p. 208 of Mage:  The Awakening). The Sphinx may add her dots in Mind as a  dice bonus to the first roll made with a given target.  Many Pathfinders discover that the first Attainment of the  Legacy is all that they require. Indeed, much of the Legacy’s  reputation is based upon the knowledge and insight conveyed  in Hidden Meaning — the ability to solve puzzles and escape  labyrinths, to see meaning in the mundane. Sphinxes who  continue on use this Attainment as a basis upon which later,  more powerful magic rests. Those who pursue other agendas,  however, use Hidden Meaning to send messages to double  agents in other factions (or even orders), to share research  with colleagues around the world, right under the noses of  their enemies, and to help Sleepers and even other mages solve  puzzles that no methods the Fallen World has produced can  fathom. Sphinxes who make frequent use of this Attainment  to encrypt messages often develop a preferred format for those  messages.  One  Sphinx  might  design  websites  dedicated  to  some inane fandom, while another writes poetry reproduced  only in small-circulation periodicals. As long as the message  reaches its intended viewer, the Sphinx doesn’t often care how  the vehicle for the message is regarded.  Sometimes, though, a Sphinx creates a vehicle for a message  that  has  resonance  and  value  in  its  own  right.  When  this happens, the message might gain fame and widespread  circulation, inadvertently passing the message along to any  mage  who  knows  how  to  look  for  it.  Some  such  messages  are even rumored to trigger Awakenings, as Sleepers on the  verge of enlightenment see the Supernal Realms lurking in  an otherwise mundane painting or song."

				"Description" : "Knowing the truth of the world by interpreting its many  hidden messages is only the first step toward the superlative  understanding that the Sphinx hopes one day to reach. Along  that way, however, she learns to take advantage of the clues  that surround her as to the fundamental nature of reality. To  the untrained eye, she looks lucky or simply confident, but to  a mage, every action she takes is fraught with significance. The second Attainment that a Sphinx can achieve allows  her  to  mimic  the  effects  of  the  Fate  2  “Exceptional  Luck”  spell (see p. 151 of Mage: The Awakening). No roll or Mana expenditure  is  required.  The  mage  simply  takes  an  instant  action to study the patterns of meaning around her, in the  same way as described for the Hidden Meaning Attainment.  The player may then designate a number of rolls equal to the  character’s Gnosis rating during the same scene to have the  9 again quality.  Pathfinders also find that the more they rely on this Attainment, the more resonant their actions become. Mage Sight  cast through the Fate Arcanum can easily detect them. Mages  attempting to use Fate spells such as “Interconnections” or  “The Sybil’s Sight” receive a +1 dice bonus during any scene  in which Sphinx has used this Attainment to gain the 9 again  quality. This bonus can cancel penalties levied by the Occultation Merit and spells such as Fate 3 “Fabricate Fortune.” Optional Arcanum: Mind 3 By listening to patterns of sound in speech (or watching  patterns of letters in written discourse), the mage can understand anything she hears or reads. This mimics the Mind 3  “Universal Language” spell, save that the mage can only understand rather than express with this Attainment. Also, she can  perform research and learning-related extended Mental tasks  in half the time they would normally take (that is, if every roll  in an extended task would normally take an hour, this time is  reduced to 30 minutes).  The second Attainment of the Sphinx Legacy opens the mage  further to the truth of the world and the hidden messages it  contains, but still does not address the question of who or  what might be sending these messages. Pathfinders at this stage  make superb interpreters, translators and researchers (which is  one reason the Mysterium teaches this Legacy). More martial  Sphinxes enjoy the tactical benefits of this Attainment, but are  careful when using it in conflict with other Awakened, as the  Sphinxes are wary of coming to the notice of powerful mages  by weaving themselves too tightly into the universe’s inner  workings. Indeed, the Sphinxes tell stories of members of the  Legacy who have become unable to see the world as anything  other  than  an  abstract  mess  of  implication  and  possibility  — unable to perceive light or sound anymore, they function  solely through the information this Attainment grants."

				"Description" : "The mage learns to “walk between” the paths of meaning in  the world, disappearing from the cycles of destiny. As far as the  world and its many layers of hidden messages are concerned,  the Sphinx no longer exists (for as long as this Attainment is  active). The Sphinx spends a moment in silent meditation,  perceiving the threads of fate and stepping between them (this  requires three turns of contemplation). After this, the mage’s  destiny can remain “invisible” in this manner for as long as  she wishes, but during this time she cannot use the Truth  Without Knowledge Attainment to gain the 9 again quality,  or cast any spell altering another person’s destiny (this include  spells dealing with oaths, such as “Alter Oath,” as well as spells  such as “Occlude Destiny” or “Destroy Bindings”). While the  Attainment is active, however, she is immune to all spells that  would perceive, alter, improve or denigrate her fate (including  the  spells  just  mentioned).  All  sympathetic  magic  targeted  against her is considered to be four steps further removed.  (So, to even attempt targeting her with a sympathetic spell,  the caster would need an Intimate connection, which would  then suffer a –10 penalty as though it were Described.) Also,  the Sphinx is extremely difficult to scrutinize magically. She  is considered to have the Occultation Merit at a rating equal  to her dots in the Fate Arcanum. This  Attainment  does  not  make  the  character  physically  invisible, but does make her easy to ignore. She receives a +3  on all Stealth rolls while the Attainment is active.  Optional Arcanum: Mind 4 Reading a person’s intentions isn’t difficult; a Sphinx can  decipher a target’s basic mood and reactions enough to play  off them with the first Attainment of the Legacy. At this advanced stage, however, a tic of the eye or a shift of the hand  betrays everything about the target — his hopes, his fears and  even his memories. This effect is much like the Mind 4 “Read  the Depths” spell (see p. 215 of Mage: The Awakening). The  mage must spend at least one turn studying the target before  using this Attainment. After that, the player rolls Intelligence +  Academics – the subject’s Composure. Unlike Read the Depths,  mages with the Mind Arcanum do notget a chance to detect  the Attainment’s effect, since it is based entirely on external  observation rather than telepathic intrusion. Modifiers for distant memories might apply, but memories or experiences that  significantly contributed to the target’s development (such as  child abuse or the death of an important figure) might actually  grant bonuses, even if the target has repressed them.  The third Attainment of the Legacy allows the Sphinx to  exert  some  influence  over  the  world’s  meanings.  Very  few  Sphinxes progress to this point, because most of them focus  more on discovering what being or phenomenon is responsible  for the meaning of the world. Those who do are among the  most powerful and inscrutable beings in the World of Darkness, fully in tune with the world’s patterns and able to step outside of those patterns at any time."

				"Text" : "Among the most enigmatic of Legacies is the Subtle Ones, mages who “do without doing,”who are “inthe world but not ofit.”Look for them and they are gone. Many doubt their very existence, but those who understand their ways can detect their influence throughout the world. Their names are not recorded by history, but much of history was written by them. Their faces may not be found upon monumental statuary, but most monuments are carved according to proportions devised by a Subtle hand. Though they heed no bounds and move by routes unknown, it is their pen that dictates where roads and borders are laid. To some they are skulking villains who dare not show their faces. To others they are the secret chiefs of the great conspiracy that brings the world to order. To themselves, they are simply the Subtle Ones, or the Ahl-i-Batin, the “People of the Inner Truth”who serve as the culture-bearers of civilization —not by bringing the world to order, but by bringing order to the world. Batini magic utilizes sacred geometry to open the mind to divine reality. By studying the complexities of spatial relationships and proportionality, the soul can compose itself to harmonize with the world, and so compose the world. Subtle lore traces itself back to the architects and city planners of Atlantis, for whom sociology was no mere science but a magical art. They believed that a harmonious society that both sustains and fulfills all its members could be achieved through proper patterning of the space it occupies, engendering proper patterns of behavior in occupants. This social engineering concerned itself with everything from broad geographical plans to the minutiae of detail in art, music and literature. Every aspect of culture could be made to reflect —and so teach and encourage —greater social harmony. The Subtle Ones exerted substantial influence in all the great civilizations of the world up through the European Renaissance until their power, obtained largely through the work of agents placed within major political and religious institutions, waned as secular society waxed. At present, the Subtle Ones are too few and scattered to enact any of their plans on a large scale, but have learned to keep themselves insinuated into the ever-changing administrations of modern politics, mostly by seizing posts within the intelligence community. They also maintain a constant presence in the worlds of art, fashion, communication and education. From these positions they can control (or at least influence to some nominal degree) the excesses and vicissitudes of society at large. Because the Subtle Ones are so arcane and secretive about themselves, their motives are often called into question by other mages. Their hand has been discerned in innumerable plots and intrigues throughout history, most notably in the Order of Assassins, a deviant sect of Ishmaelite Islam. From its network of impregnable mountaintop fortresses, this group dispatched highly trained operatives to extend its influence, from fanatically suicidal hit men to skilled and patient deep-cover agents. Some consider this sect to be the Subtle Ones’crowning achievement, a spiritually inclined utopian society sustaining itself in the midst of a hostile social climate with a minimum of military force. Others see the Assassins as the very worst of the Subtle Ones’work —secluded and insular, using murder as a tool to separate themselves from the outside world for an autocratic leader who claims overweening spiritual authority while commanding his mind-slaves to kill themselves as a demonstration of his power. The final words of the sect’s founder, the legendary Old Man of the Mountain, Hassan-i-Sabbah — “Nothing is true, everything is permitted!” —is often taken to indicate the deeply amoral identity of this Legacy. In fact, the Subtle Ones do not hesitate to engage in acts that would be condemned by most spiritual traditions. The Ahl-i-Batinalso employ a number of ascetic practices taken to potentially dangerous extremes, including fasting, flagellation and self-mutilation. Their long history of brainwashing, mind control and social manipulation is cause for concern as well. Among their other disciplines, they cultivate the way of the unseen assassin, and are not above using violence or a convincing threat of violence to achieve their aims. Thus, they can be said to wield considerable temporal power. The Subtle Ones do not consider themselves to be the masters of the world, but merely the goad-servants of human evolution, scourging mankind to drive it up the spiritual slope toward an eventual postulated universal Awakening. As to when this will occur, the Legacy presents no clear answer. At present, the prevailing view is that too many secrets have been discovered (or leaked) to the Sleepers too soon, granting humanity a capacity for destruction in disproportionate excess to its current degree of moral development. This course presents a danger to the world as a whole, mages included, and so must be curbed by whatever means necessary."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "The Subtle Ones have made a science of anonymity and tend to blend into their surroundings, taking on local dress and customs with great facility, able to disappear instantly into a crowd or traffic. Inheritors of this Legacy are noted —if identified at all —for their quiet and reserved demeanor, as well as for their piercing gaze."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "The historical influence of the Subtle Ones was most strongly expressed among various esoteric traditions of the Middle East —gnosticism, qabalism, Sufism — and so many of its most enlightened members come from those traditions. Most of the terminology found in this Legacy is of Arabic or Persian derivation. The operations of the Subtle Ones are global in scope and their methodology is highly eclectic, so that Subtle Ones can be found almost anywhere. (Actually, it might be more correct to say that Subtle Ones are in place almost anywhere in the world. Whether they can actually be found is another matter.)"
			}, {
				"Title" : "Organization",
				"Text" : "Once his apprenticeship has concluded, the Subtle One seldom makes direct contact with other inheritors of his Legacy. Groups do sometimes form for a particular purpose, though; these are tightly knit and highly insular cells so extravagantly surreptitious that each member may not even know the identities of the others. Meetings are conducted with faces veiled and bodies cloaked. Speech never rises above a whisper, and separate routes are taken for entrances and exits. One might ask, with such a pall of secrecy, how the Ahl-i-Batinare able to maintain communications, much less a global conspiracy. The “master plan”of the Atlantean social engineers is reiterated throughout Batinilore, such that no inheritor is left without a thorough understanding of the role he is to play in the process of human evolution. This is not to imply that a Subtle One is merely a cog in a great machine, following a preprogrammed pattern. On the contrary, creativity and originality are prized and encouraged both within the Legacy and in the world at large. The local details of the collective plan vary from region to region, even from neighborhood to neighborhood in large cities, so facets must be communicated to newcomers. A Subtle One is trained to read broad cultural patterns — power structures, economic concerns, religious beliefs, artistic trends and personal tendencies —into styles of dress, art, building and music. Simply by glancing at any street corner or marketplace, he can divine any number of particulars about his surroundings. For example, the seemingly innocuous advertisements for shaving cream on local billboards might clue him in about a new religious fundamentalism that’s taking hold in the community, even though it’s not yet evident in anyone’s behavior. While the connection between shaving cream and fundamentalism would never occur to a casual observer, the subtle strands of unconscious belief and desire represented by the two forces are obvious to the Subtle One observer, allowing him to make intuitive leaps of understanding that are irrational or mystifying to others. Furthermore, Batiniare likely to have encoded their own innovations into the social fabric. Visitors might read specific messages and even elaborate reports in such ubiquitous details as an architectural ornament, a hemline border stitch, the layout of streets or the melody of a popular folk tune."

Many examples of such ancient controls exist: Stonehenge, Mayan temples and even some Roman roads exist along ley lines or sit atop powerful nodes. By focusing the energy that courses over the Earth, the ancients were able to influence natural and unnatural occurrences wherever the energy flowed. They could cause crops to produce untold harvests, or create blight that led to starvation and death. They could inspire wisdom and understanding or fuel depravity and breed despair. And, through careful control of resonance, the Tellurians could aid in the creation of a nation or bring one to its knees. Wherever people have sought to control the power these lines possess, the Tellurians have always been nearby. Ever since the fall of Atlantis, these mages have dedicated their lives to understanding the power that flows from node to node. They have amassed vast libraries of maps detailing ley lines all over the world. However, as the world evolves and changes, so does the energy that flows around it. The work of the Tellurians is never done because the lines are constantly shifting. The original Tellurians were a disparate lot. Each discovered the power of the ley lines within their own cultures and learned to manipulate them as they advanced along their chosen Paths. Eventually they stumbled across other members of other Paths and orders who shared their interests, and the first Telluric Council was formed. They agreed that the ley lines should be observed and manipulated only for the prosperity of mankind. To enforce their will, they created the Telluric Wardens, a militant division that punishes those offenders who dare to destroy or manipulate ley lines for destructive purposes. The Obrimos were the original founders of the Tellurians because of their leanings towards the Prime Arcanum and interest in the flow of magic. Eventually, the Mysterium became interested in these trackers of ley lines, and other Paths were introduced to the Legacy. Each Path was able to turn their particular talent to understanding the resonances that supply the main power to the ley lines. The Acanthus devote themselves primarily to understanding how the particular resonances of ley lines and nodes affect the fates of those they touch. Mastigos are often the most adept with their knowledge of the Space Arcanum, and provide some of the best cartographers the Legacy possesses. The Moros of the Legacy are few and far between, although those who have joined focus most of their attention on how the different resonances affect Matter and inanimate objects. As the Legacy’s founders, Obrimos are by far the most common Path represented. The Thyrsus are a close second within the Legacy, as they are intimately concerned with the effects ley lines have on the physical and spiritual landscapes of the world."

The Mysterium considers most of the members of the Legacy to be entertaining and largely useless old eccentrics. However, they arethe foremost experts in the field of mapping and understanding of resonances. The Mysterium is where most of the Legacy’s students are recruited from as they seek mentors in the Order’s libraries to extract information on the peculiar science of ley lines. The Wardens tend to come from the Adamantine Arrow. They are often found watching over nodes or acting as bodyguards to their researching colleagues. They are also the enforcers of the Telluric Council’s will, protecting fragile lines or punishing mages who disturb or destroy lines wantonly. The Guardians of the Veil, Free Council and Silver Ladder are in the minority of the orders represented among the Mapmakers. After induction into the Legacy, most members remain in their parent order, but a fair number end up defecting to the Mysterium."

If they believe the lines are to be controlled, they tend to be neat freaks, with their clothes and surroundings perfect in every detail.

Some followed the traditions of the Druids, manipulating all sorts of connections from toadstool circles to Stonehenge. Others learned the arts of feng shuiand manipulate the dragon lines on smaller levels in residential areas. However, they all followed their passion even after their Awakening, and sought greater understanding of ley lines through their magic. Most Mapmakers keep fastidious notes and maps so that they can keep track of the ley lines in their area and the different resonances that travel down them. Often they hold positions of power in the mortal world, which allow them to manipulate the architecture in the city they reside in or own swathes of untouched virgin forests to preserve the lines flowing within them."

Rank among the Mapmakers is due to age and accomplishment. Once in a blue moon, a younger member will perform a truly remarkable feat that earns them the respect and recognition of the Council, but most of the Mapmakers operate under the simple rule of “avoid the Council’s attention.” The strongest connection within the Legacy is between mentor and student. Someone interested in joining the Legacy has to first locate a Mapmaker who is willing to take him on as a student. He is then introduced to the Attainments and the vast libraries that the Mapmakers have accumulated over the centuries in the study of ley lines. Once the mentor believes the student is ready, the student faces a test to become a full-fledged member of the Legacy. This trial usually comes after the student learns the second Attainment. The tests range from successfully documenting the resonances of a particularly complex ley line to the mapping of all lines that intersect with a particular node. Once they successfully pass the test, they are free to do as they please. There is, however, retribution if a Mapmaker steps over the line. The Council’s interpretation of a wrongdoing does not follow most societal norms; they are far more concerned with the disruption of energy flow along the lines, and anything that destroys or significantly interferes with a large amount of ley lines will draw the Council’s immediate attention. Wardens are then dispatched to deal with the offending party."

Through mastery of Space and knowledge of the components of ley lines, the Mapmaker can enter any ley line at any point and travel to any node. Many Mapmakers explain it as opening a Portal (as per the spell in Mage: The Awakening, p. 238) and simply using the ley lines as a conduit. While they can enter a ley line at any point, they can only exit at a node, where the power lines cross and the energy is briefly disrupted. Many younger Mapmakers describe it as akin hopping a train or riding the subway. The Mapmaker can only take herself on the Ride, along with any non-living things she can hold onto. While the mage is Riding Between, they exist with the ley line and travel along its energy. They cannot be harmed until they step out at a node. Riding Between isn’t without its risks: unless the Mapmaker knows exactly where he is going, he could very well end up on top of a mountain in Tibet, in the middle of a battlefield in Africa or over the ocean in the middle of a hurricane."

The Mapmaker must make a Gnosis + Prime roll to activate this attainment – the length of time the ley line is moved is as per the prolonged Duration table in Mage: The Awakening, p. 120."

Small nuances in how a word is spoken, or used, can create major differences in meaning that would be almost impossible to comprehend just by studying the writings of a dead language. This is especially true in a tonal language (such as Chinese) in which the same word can have multiple meanings depending on how the syllable is stressed. It is no wonder, then, that some Atlantean words are difficult to translate properly into modern languages built on comparatively limited concepts. There are some who claim that Timori is one such word that has likely received an incomplete translation. Timori can certainly be translated as fearful. The word probably was used in association with the Locust-Eaters, who forsook magic to take their place in what they perceived as the natural order of the world. But those who tread this path state that another possible translation for Timori, one that has been overlooked or suppressed by modern scholars, is “feared.”"

				"Text" : "In the Dark Ages, when mages held more sway in the world and the orders waxed in power, great resources were spent in plumbing the most profound secrets of the earth. Sanctums swelled with students, vast libraries of lore were gathered, and expeditions were mounted to the most remote extremities of the globe. Mages journeyed to mist-shrouded mountaintops in legendary lands, deserted isles in uncharted latitudes, lost cities crumbling beneath waves of water, sand or jungle, and into the moldy vaults of rumor-haunted necropolises of antiquity. Some of those who pursued this last course dug too deep into the past and literally awoke the dead. Even the most finely honed Awakened would be sorely pressed to resist the chilling intensity of an undying desire that has festered in darkness and hunger for centuries. These mages found that they had, willingly or not, taken on new instructors, keepers of profound knowledge and wielders of terrifying power, teachers who might have been human once, but were no longer. Masters with a particularly insatiable need. Vampirism is a state of being that comes with fantastic potential, but it is nonetheless a curse. Young vampires do not always grasp the full import of this simple fact, but as the sunless decades of hunger pass, they learn that undying existence is not the same as eternal life. Raging against this fate, an obscure line of vampires called the Tremere encountered an entity from the Abyss and wrested from it certain secrets about the Supernal and Fallen Worlds. Using this forbidden knowledge, they formulated in their blood a way of circumventing their curse by stealing from the living the inner light that they themselves lacked. Through the drinking of blood, a Tremere could tap a victim’s soul, allowing him to live for a short time as if he were nearly human, walking in twilight (but not full daylight) and becoming sated by normal food rather than blood. The process desiccated the stolen soul, however, leaving its owner to wither away into a slow, witless death. The souls of normal humans proved too dim and murky to sustain the Tremere for more than a few days at best. The undead needed something much brighter and clearer. They found what they needed in the Awakened souls of the mages who intruded into their lair, but the very brilliance they desired also ensured that their intended victims were not mere cattle to be seized and consumed with impunity. The mages had to be lured into the fold with intimations of ancient power and arcane lore. The vampires made good on their temptations, unveiling some of the deepest mysteries of vampiric lore. The mages eagerly took the bait, heedless of the cost that would be exacted from them. In tapping the mages’souls while they drank of their blood, the vampires discovered that their Abyssal lore had failed them. The blood burned in their veins with celestial fire and rendered their bodies to ash in mere moments, destroying every single one of them. But their damnation did not end with them. They passed on a part of their curse to their vessels, infecting the mages with the most virulent aspect of their unique Abyssal damnation. The mages, though not undead, had placed one foot firmly on the far side of the grave and found their souls eroding away into the great darkness beyond all light. The spiritual vacuum thus created eventually spread to their outward forms, consuming their bodies until some of them ceased to exist, or else wandered the earth as hungry ghosts. To fill their growing void, the survivors learned to steal the light from those who had it. They had become living vampires, stealers of souls. At first, these sorcerers took the vampires’name, Tremere, as a title to describe their condition: “Tremere-inflicted.”Other mages just called them the Tremere, and over time the lichs accepted this shorthand for themselves, although it is still used as an adjective: “Tremere lich.” A mage must be voluntarily initiated into this Legacy by having his own soul severed by his teacher and replaced with someone else’s. The soul link between instructor and pupil transmits the lich curse once the new soul is attached. Usually, the master then attaches the pupil’s soul to himself, for Awakened souls last much longer than Sleeping souls. It is extremely rare for a young or even middle-aged mage to make this hideous choice. Usually, only those near the end of their natural life spans choose to become lichs in hopes that, by unnaturally extending their lives on a diet of souls, they might unlock the key to ascension and rise to the deathless lands of the Supernal World. And yet, it is possible for a pupil to reverse course and restore his humanity before he has gone too far. If he can regain his own soul and reattach it (using spells, not Tremere attainments) before he raises his Gnosis above the amount of dots he had when he was first initiated into this Legacy, and then if he sacrifices a dot of Willpower, he loses all Tremere attainments and become fully ensouled again. He cannot, however, learn any other Legacy ever again. He cannot engage in soulcraft with a Tremere-touched soul, even though he has overcome the Legacy’s curse. Some have wondered if the vampiric bloodline that damned the mages to lichdom still survives. Although the Tremere mages have searched for any signs of it, they have found none."

		"Notes" : "The length of time a stolen soul preserves a lich depends on the lich’s age. [[MtAw_Legacy_TremereLich_SoulNourishment]] Once a soul begins to erode, a Tremere loses one Willpower dotper week until his will is gone. With each lost dot, the Tremere’s body takes on increasingly morbid features, becoming necrotic until he resembles a rotting corpse or mummy (although his traits are not affected). Once he has no more Willpower dots, he can no longer regain Willpower points (through a Virtue, Vice or any other means), and he then begins to suffer one aggravated Health wound per week. He cannot heal this damage naturally, and it is Resistant, meaning it cannot be healed supernaturally (see “Resistant Damage,” p. 124). Unless he gets a new soul before he runs out of Health, he perishes completely, with no trace or remnant of his identity left in the Tapestry. Only replacing an eroding soul with a fresh soul stops the decline, and the damage begins to heal naturally. Once the Tremere’s Health is restored, he then begins regaining Willpower dots at a rate of one per week. A mage’s soul is far more valuable than any mere mortal’s. Each Awakened soul can actually reduce a Tremere’s chronological age by one stage on the chart above. Thus, a 100-year-old Tremere requires a human soul each month, but if he can steal the soul of another mage (other than a Tremere), he can go six months without a fresh sacrifice."

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "Since the dawn of civilization, mankind has dreamed of creating wealth from worthless matter. Such a dream can be made real, mankind found, but only through hard work and a bit of luck. A lump of stone or wood can, through carving, grinding or knapping, be made into an object that is useful, beautiful or both. Patience and toil can be applied to a patch of dirt to cause crops to spring up or livestock to increase and grow strong. Those willing to sacrifice their time and effort in this way often seem to feel that basing their lifestyle on such activity yields not only material wealth but also endows the soul with extended qualities of utility and beauty. Not everyone was willing to put forth such effort, though, so some devised shortcuts to wealth, claiming credit for the work of others or even claiming the product of that work for themselves. They divorced the notion of “wealth”from the material benefits of work, reducing riches to a system of artificial value placed upon rare metals or gems (and later to printed scraps of paper and then to glowing numbers on a monitor screen). The actual work of enriching life was denigrated as a lowly occupation and the soulcraft it engendered dismissed as fantasy by those unwilling to engage in it. Getting something for nothing only leaves one wanting more. Empty wealth, like food without nutrients, can be addictive, expanding the vacuum it was intended to fulfill. Into such a vacuous society there inevitably resurfaced distorted legends that told of how the mages of old learned the secret of tuning lead into gold, dirt into money, shit into Shinola. With the legends came charlatans, those who claimed to know the trick of getting something for nothing, who were sought out by kings with vacuous coffers, who fleeced their patrons by wrapping their lead ingots in polished brass foil and slipped out of the palace by night with their own empty wealth jingling in their purses. So the legends fell into disrepute (but without ever disappearing entirely) while the quest for empty wealth continued. The truth behind those legends would shock the royal addicts who heard them. Indeed, the mages of Atlantis had learned the “trick”of transmuting one substance into another, but it was only an incidental side effect of their real work. Their labors were not ultimately directed toward the external material world, but inward. Like land, wood or stone, the human soul can be cultivated and shaped, they found, transformed into something both greater and finer than what it might otherwise be. The “lead”that they operated upon was themselves, and the “gold”that they created was themselves. This is not to say that their “alchemy”was a purely contemplative practice, a type of meditation cloaked in a physical metaphor. The image of the secluded chamber with its kiln and clutter of alembic, retort and crucible is factually accurate. Experimentation in the material plane was as much a part of their practice as spiritual discipline. Engaging in a physical craft with an appropriate mindset of self-observation can synchronize changes in both the inner and outer worlds. This Legacy teaches that true understanding is best reached by mirroring the inner process with the outer. Just as matter can be shaped by heat and cold, by hammer’s blow and chisel’s cut, so too can the soul be shaped by pleasure and pain, by feeling and thought. Emotional baggage or faulty modes of thought can be trimmed away and desirable qualities such as honesty and compassion may be added to the alloy mixture in the crucible of the soul. Imperfection can be burned off, boiled out or frozen and chipped away. The soul’s purest essence may be distilled out of the woes and trauma that weigh it down, leaving it free to become that which is rarer and more precious than gold — the fulfilling life of the complete person. Inheritors of this Legacy are known as the “Uncrowned Kings,”a term that most outsiders take to refer to the age of the charlatans, when the rulers of the world could be led by their vacuous desires and anyone who knew those desires could easily become a true “power behind the throne.”But a more esoteric meaning is hidden in the name. Having perfected the technique of crafting their own souls, the Uncrowned could truly claim to be “self-made men,”masters of their own souls. Their “royalty”is based, not upon primogeniture or the hoarding of hollow wealth, but upon the noble qualities that they have cultivated within themselves. They do not rule over nations, but over themselves to a degree that “common”folk can scarcely imagine. The qualifier “Uncrowned”is equally significant on an esoteric level, beyond the fact that they do not openly display their unique nobility. The adornment of precious metals and gems is at once a metaphoric image connoting inner nobility and personal power, a reference to the physical transmutations that this Legacy practices. The title is also an oblique suggestion of the halo found in religious iconography denoting a brilliance or radiance of consciousness so bright that it shines directly through the skull (normally visible to those with aura perception but sometimes accessible to Sleepers in a religious context). But these Kings are emphatically Uncrowned, eschewing not only the lauds of their peers, but also the empty wealth that they are capable of creating."

Intelligence + Crafts is rolled, and the time per roll is at least half an hour, but it can be longer depending on the craft involved. If a month passes without him purifying his soul through the meditative process of labor, he loses his attainments until he succeeds in his calling. Whenever a mage uses the 2nd or 3rd Uncrowned attainment, his head is wreathed in a shining halo, the sign of his alchemically purified soul.

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "In seeking to grasp the higher order of the Supernal World, many mages look beyond the artificial reality constructed and maintained by mankind, toward the world of nature. While others leaf through dusty tomes or gaze into the smooth, polished surfaces of mirrors or glass balls in their secluded sanctums, there are those willing to step outside and draw knowledge and power from a greater world not of their own making. They read their incantations and prophecies in the stir of branches in the wind and the fall of leaves. They draw power and strength from the green, growing world. There is a secret language in nature, and from those who are able to read it nothing in the Fallen World may be hidden, for all things are interconnected and everything is reflected in everything else. Nature displays its treasures for all to see, but unfolds in ways that few can ever fully comprehend, changeless only in its ever-changing evolutions, devolutions and revolutions. The diligent mage may divine the intricate syntax and grandiose grammar of this secret language, glimpsing even deeper secrets in the Mists that enshroud mysteries beyond mortal comprehension. Most would halt or turn back, but some press on into this nature beyond nature, this “supernature,”if you will. In the Mists can be found the implicit order from which the visible world grows, the sleeping giants whose bodies are the land, whose breath is the wind, of whose voices the thunder is but an echo. Here is where the faces of nymphs shine through flower and fruit and leaf, where the dances of sylphs trace breeze and gale, where gnomes churn away at the molten heart of the mountain. This is where magic is born, and even the mightiest mage must tread carefully or not at all. The Walker in Mistsreaches beyond the seen into the unseen, tapping magic at the source of all life as was done in times long forgot. Other mages look within themselves, or up at distant heavens, but the Walker actually travels in the world seeking realms of pure enchantment. He knows the deep caverns of the earth where dragons yet sleep, and what ancient invisible roads lead to the fae countries. It was the Walker in Mists who first taught mankind to mark the trails it followed and to recognize landmarks that could lead unerringly from region to region. Rather than following seasonal growth or available game, mankind could choose its own path to its destiny. In short, he taught us not simply to migrate, but to actually travel. To the more settled folk he gave games of chance —the vagaries of which teach, in miniature, the mysteries of fate and destiny —that they too might experience the adventure of the unknown. But with the spread of civilization, mankind forgot the wisdom of the Walker, taking his gifts for granted and detaching itself from the rhythms and cycles of the natural world. Even his games of chance — once used to divine the very will of the gods themselves —degenerated into a competitive orgy of materialistic greed, attracting crime and corruption. As broad, well-traveled roads carved up the wilderness and creased the face of the earth, the Walker found it increasingly necessary to rely upon ley lines to guide him invisibly through the Mists from grove to lake to mountain as he visited the few remaining sacred sites. In modern times, he is completely marginalized, a loner patrolling the fringes of the overdeveloped world."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "While Walkers seem to occupy the extremes of the physiognomic spectrum, most tend toward lean physiques, better suited for constant travel, and often have tanned skin from the time spent outdoors (although, oddly, with generally smooth complexions). Most favor simple functional clothing when on the road, but all invariably seem to exhibit some natural flamboyance, howsoever understated, that usually blends bohemian and hippie fashions with styles from older historical periods: headbands and armbands, sashes instead of belts, robes or kilts instead of trousers. "
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "Inheritors of the Walking Legacy may emerge from nearly any socioeconomic demographic, although the super-rich seldom manage to take on the risks of this lifestyle. Those who travel frequently out of necessity or vocation are more likely to encounter a Walker, while those of an imaginative or artistic bent are more likely to appreciate a Walker’s enchantments and seek to learn about the wonders he conjures. The subculture of gambling has provided fertile ground for this Legacy, but all Walkers unanimously abhor the commercialism that has degraded their once-sacred pastime."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Organization",
				"Text" : "Every Walker in the Mists is accustomed to the life of the solitary nomad. Although all destinies are shared, all paths leading to destiny are separate. Even teacher and student must part ways eventually. The crossing of paths, therefore, is a momentous occasion inaugurated by lengthy introductions recounting each Walker’s origins and travels, followed by a kind of singing-game in which each takes turns reciting his tutorial lineage until a common spiritual ancestor is found. After that, any food, provisions or contraband carried by each is pooled and shared. Then there may be a general discussion of the omens and portents of the current age, followed by another singing-game in which travel itineraries are compared so that warnings can be given about possible past and future destinations, with particular emphasis on immediate dangers. (This exchange is in accordance with the old bardic line, “When two meet, each is about to go where the other has just been.”) In times of impending crisis or necessary haste, all but the final phase of the ceremony may be dispensed with until some later date when convenience allows. The crossing of paths is rare, and even rarer when paths intertwine so that bands of Walkers take to the Mists. Walker groups, notoriously short-lived, are the stuff of legend, unheard of in the modern day. Rumors sometimes circulate of Walker families who tend to the world’s dwindling virgin wildernesses and sacred sites.  "

		"AttainmentDescription" : "To truly walk the Mists, the mage who learns this Legacy needs to be proficient in the Mysteries of Life and Space. These attainments work best in natural environments or in places of ancient power.

				"Description" : "The mage peers into the Mists, the continuum of Nature that lies hidden behind the mundane world, hidden even from the Mage Sight. Doing so allows him to scry into distant places as if he were using the “Scrying”spell, p. 235. He must scry through the medium of plant life — trees, flowers, bushes or even grass. As long as there is some form of plant tor is found. After that, any food, provisions or contraband carried by each is pooled and shared. Then there may be a general discussion of the omens and portents of the current age, followed by another singing-game in which travel itineraries are compared so that warnings can be given about possible past and future destinations, with life in the place he wishes to scry, the mage can see there. To peer into the Mists and spy the desired location (i.e., to open a scrying window), an instant action is performed and Wits + Survival + Space is rolled, modified by the sympathetic distance (see pp. 114-115). After he has established the window, a reflexive action is required to view through it. Optional Arcanum:Time 2 If the mage also has Time 2, he can peer into the past at the location he is scrying, similar to the “Postcognition”spell, p. 260. He literally speaks to plants to get their memory of events viewed. He can view the past only if the plants currently present at the location were there during the time the mage wishes to view. "

				"Description" : "By cloaking himself (and others if desired) in the Mists, the mage can create a ward with a Ban of his choice (as long as he has the necessary Arcana knowledge), similar to the “Ward”(p. 236) and “Ban”(p. 237) spells. He can do this only amidst nature, where at least one green shoot grows from the earth. One Willpower point must be spent to summon the Mists if green space is lacking. To create the ward/Ban, he performs an instant action (no roll required) and affects an area based on his Space dots. <table class='jhInline' style='border:1px solid;'><tr><th>Radius or</th><th>Unique Area</th><th>Space Dots</th></tr> <tr><td>4-yard radius</td><td>20 sq. yards</td><td>•••</td></tr> <tr><td>8-yard radius</td><td>40 sq. yards</td><td>••••</td></tr> <tr><td>16-yard radius</td><td>80 sq. yards</td><td>•••••</td></tr></table> If he has Space 4, you can resort to the advanced areaaffecting chart (see p. 118), using dots instead of dice penalties. Optional Arcanum:Time 3 If the mage also has Time 3, he can use Peer into the Mists (above) to divine the future, similar to the “Divination”spell (p. 263). The mage performs an instant action and can ask one question about the target’s future per Time dot. The Mists can sometimes reveal the weave of Creation before it’s made manifest. This power can be used in regard to the same target only once every 24 hours."

				"Description" : "The mage steps into the Mists, traveling wherever he desires as if he had created a Space portal. This ability is like the “Portal”spell, p. 238, although it is an instant action. The effect’s duration, however, is only for the turn in which it is activated and the subsequent turn (in which the mage and/ or his friends presumably step onto the Mist path and step out at their destination). To keep it open longer, the mage must concentrate (as with any concentration-based spell; see p. 119). He can only open a path at and travel to a place with some form of plant life (even a small patch of grass is acceptable). Others can join him on his journey through the Mists: One person of Size 5 or less can pass through the portal per turn; larger people can spend two turns squeezing through. An instant action is performed to activate this power, and Composure + Survival + Space is rolled to determine success (modified by the sympathetic distance of the destination). Optional Arcanum:Time 4 If the mage also has Time 4, he can read prophecies from within his Mist Haven (above), similar to the “Prophecy” spell (p. 264). He performs an instant action and can ask one question about a subject’s possible future (what mighthappen rather than what will happen) per Time dot. This power can be used concerning the same target only once every 24 hours."
