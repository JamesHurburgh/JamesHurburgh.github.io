Casting this spell creates a sensitivity that will warn her in such an event. This spell alerts the mage who cast it whenever something passes into or out of the spell's area of effect. Once the spell settles over an area, anything that passes through its invisible, intangible barrier during the spell's duration alerts the mage who cast it, no matter where he is. This warning manifests as a slight tingling over the body, a pressure behind the eyes, a momentary case of synesthesia, or several other minute impulses. Mages can, at the time of casting, narrow the spell's definition by declaring some things exempt from notice. The exempt thing may be general (&quot;insects and rodents&quot; or &quot;creatures of Size 2 or less&quot;) or specific (&quot;one-armed humanoids&quot; or &quot;my friend Robert&quot;), but the spell cannot differentiate based upon anything other than normal sensory input. Choosing to exempt &quot;my friend Robert&quot; from the spell draws from the mage's mental imagery to exempt anyone who appears to be Robert; the spell will not note that two people who looked like Robert passed through the barrier at the same time or delve into a person's mind to determine that the person is not actually Robert. Intrusion Warning does not endow the mage with any knowledge of what did pass the boundary (though he'll know it wasn't something he exempted), just that the spell has been breached. If the mage wishes to know anything more about the intruder, he must use additional magic, such as Space 2 Scrying, or mundane means.</P><BR>",

The Ward effectively renders a person, place, or thing immune to Space tempering, monitoring and the like until such time as the spatial barrier is overcome. (In the case of particularly old and/or paranoid willworkers, it could literally take months or years of casting to whittle their Space shields away, during which time the subject is free to fortify his Wards or seek out the one who would so crassly intrude upon his privacy.) A simple success protects an area of five square yards and gives the Ward a Potency of 1. Additional successes add to the Ward's Potency. The mage can add Target factors to increase the area. Space-based spells (sympathetic magic, scrying, teleportation, and the like) that try to pierce the Ward must exceed the protection's Potency with their own Potency. Each time one of these spells breaches the Ward, it erodes the Ward's Potency by one point, reducing its efficacy. Reinforcing a ward is an exception to the normal spell-control rules. Successive Ward spells add their excess Potency to the Ward (that is, any Potency in excess of the Ward's existing Potency), repairing any damage inflicted, and perhaps even improving upon defenses. (The defending mage does not need to create a Ward all over again unless it has been destroyed by incoming spells). The Space 3 Ban spell allows a mage to add Bans to his Wards, keeping certain phenomena from insects to motor vehicles from entering his Ward.</P><BR>",

For those who hold to such tales, it is believed that many Awakened survived the fall of Atlantis through use of this spell, opening portals in space to flee to distant sanctums to lick their wounds. Naturally, the wise mage takes some time to scry the layout of the place to which he teleports (even if it is familiar to him), just to be certain that no unwelcome surprises await. The target number is determined by the caster's sympathetic connection to the destination. One person of Size 5 or less can pass through the portal per turn (larger people can spend two turns squeezing through). Each success added to the target number allows the mage to widen the portal so that one additional person can pass through per turn. A Portal's entrance and exit can be placed anywhere that allows a person of Size 5 or less enough freedom of movement to enter or exit it in a single turn. Most Portals are used like doors, with the entrance and exit perpendicular to the ground, but the caster can be creative. The entrance and exit, however, must mirror each other on the same plane. For example, the entrance could be placed below a falling person, but the exit cannot be set to eject the falling person sideways. It must face down (as its opposite faces up). Note that, without applying the Portal Key spell, the caster cannot limit who can use the Portal. Nearby enemies can attempt to step through it, too. A person can be thrown through a portal forcibly. A hold must first be achieved in a grapple action, after which the grappler can shove the person through the Portal as an overpower maneuver. With Space 4, this spell can be cast with a prolonged Duration. With Space 5, it can be cast as an instant action (and with advanced prolonged Duration factors).

As with Portal, the more familiar the casting mage is with each location to which he creates a doorway, the easier it is to successfully cast the spell. The target number is determined by the caster's sympathetic connection to the most difficult destination to connect to. This spell is an all-or-nothing proposition, with the total number of successes determined by the least-known destination. For example, if the caster is acquainted with two of the destinations but has only encountered the third, he must accrue 12 successes to cast the spell. If he rolls eight successes, and is then halted, the spell doesn't take effect. Each portal of the Arcade spell can accommodate one person of Size 5 or less per turn (larger people can spend two turns squeezing through). Each success added to the target number allows the mage to widen all portals so that one additional person can pass through per turn. All Arcade doorway entrances and exits can be placed anywhere that allows a person of Size 5 or less enough freedom of movement to enter or exit in a single turn. Note that, without applying the Portal Key spell the caster cannot limit who can use the Arcade doorways. Nearby enemies can attempt to step through, too. Additionally, people can be forcibly thrown into any of the doorways as long as a hold is fi rst achieved in a grapple action, after which the grappler can shove the person through a doorway as an overpower maneuver.</P><BR>",

The most common use of the spell is to hinder targets caught in the cells from easily traveling to other cells within the spell's area. With one success, the spell effects a five-cubic yard area, and can affect a greater area with each additional success; see the Area-Affecting chart. This area is sectioned off into cells by the caster; he can create one division per dot of his Intelligence. Fortunately, this effect cannot cut objects or living things into pieces when it sections them off into cells. It may, however, wreak indirect havoc with people and objects outside of the spell's area, as they no longer have any spatial relationship with objects inside the spell's area. This might cause buildings to lean (but not collapse), vehicles to make strange detours and other chaotic events (most of which are left to player cleverness and Storyteller discretion). A target can leave his or her cell by stepping into another, randomly selected cell, even if it is not geographically contiguous. The caster can designate cells in three dimensions, so that a target may step from ground level to a cell in the air. He will then fall, but he might not suffer injury: As he falls from his cell into another, his destination is again randomly determined; if the new cell is on the ground level, he'll only suffer a short fall of a few feet at best. The targets' movements are not hindered, so he might move through several cells of space in a single turn. In addition, a cell's orientation is randomly shifted, so that a person running forward might suddenly find himself in a cell in which he is running in the opposite or a sideways direction. He can control his orientation and movement within a cell, but has no control over the orientation of his randomly chosen destination cell. In all cases, the Storyteller determines where each cell leads, either randomly (roll dice or use some other method based on the number of cells) or to fit the course of the story.</P><BR>",

The subject is boxed in and cannot leave under his (or its, in the case of moving objects) own power, detained until such time as the spell expires or the mage chooses to grant release (or someone else with an advanced understanding of spatial magics undoes the imprisonment). From the subject's point of view, no amount of movement in any direction results in progress toward escaping the zone of confinement. Outside observers see the subject moving but not getting anywhere. Although the subject cannot travel anywhere, he still gains his Defense against attacks to which it normally applies. This pocket of &quot;looped&quot; spatial strands can be placed directly upon a subject (in which case the subject can contest it with a reflexive Composure + Gnosis roll), or it can be set up so as to snare any who physically enter the space. With a single success, the Suspension snare covers a defined volume of five cubic yards; additional Target factors can increase this volume. The snare does not hold more cubic mass than it is designed to encompass. Made too small, it cannot hold the desired volume. Too large, and it may capture unintended individuals and objects. As the strands close about a living target, he can attempt to slip free in the first turn of contact with a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll as a contested and reflexive action. If his successes exceed the spell's Potency, he slips free of the strands. (If he is a mage, he can attempt to use countermagic instead.) Once suspended, the subject can attempt to wriggle free of the strands with an extended Dexterity + Athletics roll, with rolls once per turn and a target number equal to the Suspension spell's Potency plus its caster's Space dots. Note that a mage with Space 4 can use the Teleportation spell to instantly extricate himself from the strands. In conjunction with Death 2 or Spirit 2, Suspension affects (or can be made to ensnare) Twilight ghosts or spirits, respectively. If such beings have powers that allow them to step across the Gauntlet, they can circumvent Suspension (as can a mage using the Spirit 4 Road Master spell).

Thus, while logic might dictate that walking straight for a mile from the north bank of the river gets one to a destination, in practice, 10 miles of twists and turns, which seem to lead through much more terrain than could be possible, intervene. Taking any wrong turns waylays the journey, meaning that the traveler must find his way out (by no means a guarantee) and start over. Therefore, unless an individual is extremely lucky, he must know the way to reach his intended destination. Attempting to find the hidden site can be undertaken as an extended Intelligence + Investigation or Survival (whichever Skill is higher) action, with a target number equal to one higher than the spell's Potency and 30 minutes' time spent per roll. Any failure forces the seeker to start over. A dramatic failure gets him lost within the tangle of space surrounding the location, meaning that he must now navigate his way back to square one (a difficult task at best; he must collect the same number of successes that got him there).

The mage is capable of sculpting bizarre vicissitudes of place and distance through this level of Space, folding space in ways that defy the senses. For example, the horror-movie staple of causing every possible path of egress from a given locale to instead lead back to isolated wilderness is possible. So is making a road that a person can visually confirm leads to the store down the street, but traveling that way actually leads in the opposite direction. Needless to say, this use of the Arcanum is extraordinarily vulgar and potentially insanity-inducing if practiced in sufficiently blatant ways upon another person (almost assuredly requiring reflexive Resolve + Composure rolls for the subject to remain calm and rational).</P><BR>",

The mage could, if he wished, chop a winter's worth of firewood in an hour or so, guard every entrance to a building, or even become a one-man mob. This spell is an advanced version of Co-Location. With the Life 4 version of this spell, the mage's duplicates (one per success) are substantial, but are all extensions of the same physical presence. When one is wounded, for example, all feel pain and suffer Health wounds of damage. (The casting mage himself does not suffer wounds unless he is attacked directly.) Without adding the appropriate level of Mind (1 or 3 for multitasking), these copies do exactly what the mage does and all share in a single Defense (meaning that any attack against any copy causes the Defense of all to erode by the same amount over the course of a turn). It costs one Mana to add multitasking to the spell, regardless of the number of duplicates. With the Life 5 version of the spell, the mage can create distinct clones of himself at different locations, one clone per success and one Mana per clone. Each clone has its own Health and Defense. If a mage wants his duplicates' equipment (items intended to interact with other beings such knives or guns) to be substantial, regardless of which version of the spell is used, Matter 5 must be added to the casting and one Mana per object must be spent (which gives physical substance to each copy of the item possessed by all duplicates). As with the simpler Co-Location spell, the mage's weakest sympathetic connection (the one with the highest spellcasting penalty) is used when casting this spell.</P><BR>",

		"Effect" : "On occasion, the most effective way to deal with a foe is to break her mind. Some mages favor psychic intrusions, others use threats, while still others favor old-fashioned torture. A willworker armed with this magic need not resort to such indelicate methods. The spell banishes a person into a pocket of looped space in which the victim sees herself reflected, as though in some especially deranged funhouse. Images created through both the Forces and Time Arcana allow her to see herself in various states of disarray: Maddened, starving, dying of self-inflicted wounds, and the like. No matter where she flees, she hears her own voice, screaming at her, and hears what she believes to be her own desperate thoughts, echoing back to her from across gulfs of space and time. Implanted suggestions and false memories make moments feel like days. Needless to say, use of this magic can easily lead a mage astray from the path of Wisdom. During the Duration of this spell, an extended roll (with the same dice pool used to cast the spell) is made for the caster once every 10 minutes, contested reflexively by the victim's Composure + Gnosis. If the caster's successes exceed the target's successes, each excess success causes the target to lose one Willpower point as visions drive her mad. If the victim is reduced to zero Willpower points, she suffers a severe derangement and returns to normal space/time a gibbering wreck, likely capable of little more than curling up in a fetal ball or screaming herself hoarse. After she returns from this imprisonment, she truthfully answers any questions put to her by the spell's caster. If the subject successfully contests a roll made for the mage at any point, she returns to mental reality. She is almost certainly shaken and scared, but is perfectly capable of acting normally.</P><BR>",

		"Effect" : "Armor of one sort or another is likely almost as old as the human desire to harm one another with weaponry. Indeed, some forms of armor are so effective that they force innovations in the science of armed aggression. Arrows have long contended with various sorts of physical protection, and worked at means of circumventing them. While this spell requires a considerable degree of Awakened prowess, Phased Strike ranks among the more elegant solutions to the age-old problem. Upon casting this spell, the Arrow is capable of simply disregarding an enemy's physical armor (that is, armor not granted by a spell of the Practice of Shielding or other directly supernatural form of protection, upon which this spell has no effect), irrespective of its type, provided he himself is wielding a weapon made of inert matter -- the weapon simply passes through the armor as though it wasn't there. This is not an armor-piercing effect. If both the weapon and the armor in question are made of mundane, non-precious materials, Matter 3 is used in the casting of the spell. If the weapon and/or armor in question are made of mundane precious materials, Matter 4 is instead used. And, if the weapon and/or armor in question are made of extraordinary materials, Matter 5 is used. Note that, for the purposes of this spell, a suit of armor that is also an Enhanced or Imbued Item defaults to whatever sort of material of which it is actually composed, while an Artifact -- being of Supernal origin -- counts as extraordinary material.</P><BR>",

The mage can decrease or increase a target's Size by one point per success, to a minimum of Size 1 (when shrinking) or additional Size points equal to his Gnosis (when expanding). An SUV can be reduced to the dimensions of a toy car (though it is still a fully functional toy car, which weighs thousands of pounds). Mages who would perform such alterations are advised to remember the way in which these changes can interact with the environment. In the example of the SUV, it's recommended that one not allow the vehicle onto a muddy road (where it will sink like a stone in water due to its immense weight condensed to a tiny surface area). A target made larger through use of this spell is not made heavier; he still might be able to walk across rotting boards or thin ice that might otherwise give way to someone with a larger mass but smaller size. Affecting a base life form requires Life 2, a median life form Life 3, and a human being Life 4. Affecting an object requires Matter 2. A being's species factor is partially based on Size and partially on metabolism -- some creatures are slower than others, even though their large stride would seemingly make them faster (as with giraffes and elephants). Since this spell doesn't alter metabolism, the Size change affects Speed only partially. For every increase of two Size points, add one point of Speed. For every decrease of two Size points, subtract one point of Speed. An average human (Size 5) who becomes Size 7 gets a +1 Speed bonus, while he suffers a -1 Speed if he becomes Size 3.</P><BR>",
