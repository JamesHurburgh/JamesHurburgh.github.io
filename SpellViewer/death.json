"Effect":"This spell enables a mage to perceive the presence of Abyssal phenomena, though it is not properly a Mage Sight. Rather, this sense manifests as a powerful awareness of the pressing &quot;wrongness&quot; of the Abyss as the willworker closes on it (or, conversely, as it closes on the willworker). After casting this spell, the mage becomes attuned to the alien emanations of the Abyss, detecting them through feelings and images of fear, pain, horror, and otherwise skewed awareness of the world around him. Ordinary scenes and occurrences take on a malevolent cast, as inhuman whispers circulate through the crowd at a train station, deformed faces leer from shadowed corners (and vanish the instant the character looks back), moans of suffering and ecstasy well up from manhole covers, and other images of the gruesome and nightmarish transpire just at the edge of perception. Characters unprepared for the experience (think of the title character's glimpses of the bizarre and the terrifying in the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder for an idea of just how this sense manifests) are likely to develop 1 or more derangements. Even when Abyssal phenomena are not at hand, light seems a little cold and thin through the lens of this magic; everything looks a little more rundown, the eyes of living things are flat and unreflective, wind seems a bit too still, while normal noises sound muffled and whispers are a bit too loud. Any mage who uses this spell on too regular a basis will almost certainly find that all sense of reality begins to wear thin, as an expectation of Abyssal intrusion takes hold of her. Eventually, she might become afraid not to have this magic active -- who knows when the Abyss will come calling, after all?</P><BR>",

"Effect":"There are times when the most useful thing one can find out about a given dead body is how it got to be that way. An ability that most crime-scene investigators would give their eyeteeth for, this spell enables a mage to discern at a glance exactly how a creature died and how long ago. Thus, the mage might be able to realize that a cause of death obvious to all modern forensic evidence is in fact a ruse designed to distract from the subject's true cause of death. Because of the limitations of the Death Arcanum, Forensic Gaze reveals only cause of death and not mitigating circumstances. If used upon a human skeleton, for example, it can reveal that the individual died as a result of damage to the carotid artery two months ago to the day, but does not tell the mage that the victim also had a lethal dose of strychnine in his system at the time of his demise. This limitation on the sense can come in quite handy, however (such as finding a mutilated body and learning that it was a deliberate stab to the heart, rather than the obvious manic rending of flesh, that resulted in the person's death). Even if physical evidence of the cause of death is absent (as with a body reduced to ash), this spell reveals what killed the being in question and how much time has passed since it died. The mage peers at a corpse to ascertain the cause of death. He does not need to touch, prod, or cut into the corpse; he merely stares at it. Fairly obvious causes such as a knife wound or heart attack levy no penalties, but obscure causes such as a rare neurotoxin might cause a -2 or greater penalty. Likewise, deaths that took place more than a year ago suffer -1 dice. Deaths older than a decade suffer an additional -1 dice per decade. It is possible to detect a vampire with this spell, although the cause of death (the Embrace) is extremely obscure (-3 penalty). The caster also suffers the usual penalty of -1 die per decade that the vampire has been dead. Zombies, too, can be detected, although their state is usually obvious even to those without this spell.</P><BR>",

During the spell's casting, the willworker uses a knife or similar implement to self-inflict up to three additional points of lethal damage. For each point suffered in this manner, the mage adds one to a pool of points known as a Pain Harvest pool. Only the self-inflicted damage contributes to the Pain Harvest pool.

"Effect":"While the Forces Arcanum teaches a mage how to ignite or snuff out a light, it gives no power over the quality of darkness. In Atlantean cosmology, darkness was not merely the absence of light, but an active force. An initiate of Death learns how to manipulate that force, giving form to existing shadows or thickening them. Mages use this spell to hide themselves from easy scrutiny, literally hiding in shadows, and even sculpting shadows to best cover themselves or an awkwardly shaped object that otherwise might jut out into the light under natural conditions. A simple success allows a mage to shape a one-yard radius area of shadows or darkness into shapes of his choosing, or he can thicken its gloom, making shadows deeper even under bright light. The Storyteller assesses the quality of existing shadows, categorizing them into three degrees: From light to dark to complete darkness. Each success deepens the darkness by one degree. Once complete darkness is achieved, additional successes impose dice penalties to perception rolls on a one-for-one basis for anyone peering into the area. With Death 2, the mage can give shadows animation, while Death 3 allows him to conjure them.</P><BR>",

"Effect":"The mage can magically knock a Sleeper's soul out of alignment. This does not remove the soul, or it physically harm the Sleeper, but the lack of alignment does make him more susceptible to soul-affecting magic in the future. The mage, for her part, can use this spell as a weapon or a threat, but it is more commonly used by the Echo Walkers to gain information about the Ones Before. The mage must touch the target to enact this spell (at Death 3, she can cast this spell at sensory range). The target feels a sudden chill and then a profound feeling of distance and isolation, as though he were miles away from everything in his vicinity. The mage, through the use of the Prime Arcanum, can see &quot;behind&quot; the soul, viewing the Sleeper on a spiritual level so primitive that no part of his individual ego is present. Most mages find the experience profoundly disturbing, because a human being stripped of his individual humanity is simply a great deal of instinct and a little bit of intellect. Thus, it is possible to cast this spell using only the Death Arcanum, which knocks the soul out of joint but does not convey any mystical insight. This glimpse behind the soul lasts only a turn, after which the mage loses focus on the soul and must cast this spell on a different Sleeper in order to see this &quot;proto-soul.&quot; While the mage peers through the gap, the player can make a Gnosis roll. If the roll is successful, the mage regains a spent Willpower point. Doing so too often, however, can have a serious drawback -- the mage becomes addicted to what she sees through the gap, and for every week that passes in which she does not successfully use this spell to get a glimpse, she suffers a cumulative -1 dice penalty on all Social- and Mental-related rolls. When this addiction sets in is up to the Storyteller; one possibility is that it occurs as soon as the mage loses a dot of Wisdom from casting this spell. It is safe to assume that most, if not all, Echo Walkers suffer from this addiction. The effects on the Sleeper target are long-lasting and brutal. The target becomes depressed, irritable, and unable to relate to others as well as he once could. All Social rolls suffer a -1 dice penalty until the Sleeper can realign his soul. Doing this requires the target to reaffirm his connection to the rest of humanity, meaning that some people can correct the damage within a few hours (a loving father, for example, might find that spending an afternoon caring for his children does the trick, while an ER doctor might save someone's life and repair the damage). Other people can help the person realign his soul -- therapy, spiritual counseling, or simply positive attention can shift the victim's soul back into place (this might require a roll of, for instance, Manipulation + Empathy for counseling or Intelligence + Medicine for psychiatric help, though it's worth noting that pharmaceutical remedies don't help matters). People who lack the tools to fix the damage themselves, however, often make it worse. Any degeneration rolls made for the victim while the soul is dislodged automatically fail, and any derangements gained are considered severe. The victim often becomes suicidal (or, occasionally, violent) within a week or two. A person afflicted by this spell can be detected by the Death 1 Soul Marks spell. Any spell that affects the human soul receives a +2 dice bonus when cast upon a Sleeper suffering the effects of Dislodge Soul. The Spirit 3 Restore Lost Soul spell can also correct the damage that Dislodge Soul causes. Doing so requires the restoring mage to accumulate a number of successes equal to the Potency of the Dislodge Soul spell. Casting this spell upon a Sleeper requires a degeneration roll for mages of Wisdom 2 or more. This spell cannot be cast upon Awakened targets, although a Death 4 version of this spell can target mages.</P><BR>",

Most often, it is used to allow a Twilight ghost to manifest without suffering any dice modifiers for location or the presence of mortals. The ectoplasm takes the shape of the ghost's own image. Successes are allocated between the ectoplasm's Size (base 5 or less, plus one per allocated success) and its solidity. Its base solidity is like a spider web's, but allocated successes can make this denser and thicker, giving the ectoplasm some weight and increasing detail. A ghost that manifests through ectoplasm with one success of solidity has only vague features. With two successes, its face can be recognized by those who knew it in life. Five successes make it look almost real (except for its uniform white color). Even with five successes (the maximum solidity), a material being or object can pass through the ectoplasm with little resistance.

The spell requires the presence of a corpse. While the eyes do not need to be intact, the spell does require a more substantial corpse than mere ashes, though a decapitated head will suffice. Although mages often use this spell in the hopes of discovering the identity of an unknown killer (since the spell is limited to the last thing the victim saw before dying), if the victim was shot by a sniper from far away or poisoned, the spell will not reveal the identity of the killer.

"Effect":"Through the casting of this spell, the mage gains the power to physically interact with ghosts and ghostly things in Twilight state. (&quot;Ghostly things&quot; are usually parts of a spectre's anchors, which often exhibit ephemeral existence even after their material counterparts have crumbled to dust). She could, for example, pull a ghostly hammer out of a Twilight room in order to pound a nail into a wall. She could take the spectral reflection of a key out of the lock in which it was broken, pull it through into materiality, and use it to open the material lock barring her from entering a room she wishes to access. She can also touch ghosts and be touched (or attacked) in return by any nearby shade. Such beings tend to be, at best, cold and clammy and many have other disturbing and not entirely tactile sensations associated with physical contact. Some spectres have been known to long for physical contact with the living in ways most unhealthy or inappropriate. The caster cannot damage ghosts, or affect non-dead spirits such as fetches or mental projections, including vampires using the Twilight Projection Discipline (she needs the Spirit and Mind Arcana, respectively, for those effects). Objects drawn from Twilight possess Durability 1 and crumble into a fine ash if broken, regardless of their original consistency. Nothing really makes these items superior to (or even the equal of) those a mage could acquire normally in the material world, but being able to snatch the revolver from the nearby ghost of a police officer when the mage is attacked can be a lifesaver. Note that objects found in Twilight are only infrequently the same as those found in the material world, as only lost or broken objects tend to manifest in that state. Objects that serve as anchors (or even those that once served as anchors but are now missing from the material world, either through decay or destruction) also often appear in Twilight.

"Effect":"While any mage can commit a living sacrifice to gain Mana, this spell is an act of sorcerous cannibalism that allows a willworker to regain strength from the souls of the dying without necessarily killing them (although it certainly harms them). A mage can restore her resolve or &quot;burn out&quot; a living human Pattern for its Mana, drawing this energy directly into her own stores to use as she will. The spell does not work if cast upon an animal; if it is, nothing happens. If used on a vampire or other form of walking dead, the spell provides no benefit to the mage. In general, the spell is meant for use upon a normal human being, and any attempt to diverge from that procedure is not apt to go well for the caster. The mage must first grab hold of the target, with a Strength + Brawl roll, subtracting the target's Defense. If successful, he can cast this spell as an instant action in the following turn. (With Death 4, he can cast this spell at sensory range as an instant action. He needs Death 5 before he can add Space 2 for a sympathetic casting.) Each success allows the mage to replenish one of his spent Willpower points by harvesting it from a person who has suffered at least one aggravated wound during the current scene (including one who has lost all of his Health to lethal damage and now suffers aggravated damage as his body dies), up to a maximum of the victim's remaining Willpower points. Alternatively, the mage may burn out a person's Pattern for points of Mana, converting the ephemeral energies that make up his idealized form into raw power. Each success inflicts one lethal Health wound onto the victim and gives the caster one Mana point. If the victim is a mage, his own Mana points are unaffected; this spell steals energy directly from his Pattern. The caster must use the Prime 5 Siphon Mana spell to directly tap an Awakened person's Mana. Direct siphoning requires a separate casting from the Willpower-harvesting version of this spell, although both effects can be combined using the normal rules for combining spells. Devouring the Slain can be used only on a given individual once, after which a new level of aggravated damage must be inflicted upon him before he can again be a target.</P><BR>",

Successfully casting this spell, which may be used only by a mage who is unconscious due to damage (with all his Health boxes filled with lethal damage, and who has &quot;rolled over&quot; into at least one box of aggravated damage) -- an exception to the normal rules for spellcasting -- destroys the casting willworker's body, killing him instantly and irrevocably. If the mage is a Disciple of Life, he may freely distribute his body's remaining fortitude (every Health box not yet filled with aggravated damage) to anyone within the spell's Area, out to a limit of a person's current maximum Health, healing any injury, whether bashing, lethal, or aggravated, on a one-for-one basis. If the mage is a Disciple of Mind, he may distribute his remaining points of Willpower in a similar manner, out to an individual's current maximum. If he is a Disciple of Prime, the willworker may distribute his remaining Mana and/or Tass (which dissolves to become Mana) to any individual capable of using such, adding it directly to her current stores, up to the maximum allowed by her Gnosis. Any or all of these effects may be combined into a single casting by a suitably skilled mage. The caster's body disintegrates completely upon the successful completion of this spell and he may not subsequently be summoned up in any form, unless somehow previously and willingly metaphysically bound to such a fate. Th&eacute;archs believe this is because such a mage, by definition, is at peace with his demise and passes on in a spirit of generosity and Wisdom. As to why this spell is covert and not vulgar, none can say for certain, though certain scholars within the Silver Ladder believe the giving of the self in such a manner is somehow protected against the Lie of the Exarchs, making the use of this spell an act of holy martyrdom in the eyes of the Oracles.</P><BR>",

The zombie can inflict lethal damage in close combat but can't perform tasks that require fine motor control. It can carry or drag large objects, for example, but can't turn a doorknob. It has the same intellectual capacity as a normal zombie. Like any object, anyone trying to damage it barehanded suffers a point of bashing damage per strike.

A mage who improvises this spell doesn't have to provide a musical component, but the player suffers a -1 to the casting roll.

Any listener whose player fails to exceed the mage's casting successes on a Composure + Gnosis roll suffers a penalty to all deliberate actions equal to the mage's successes. A &quot;deliberate&quot; action is one into which the character must put conscious effort. Attacking an enemy, searching for an exit, and driving a car are all deliberate actions, but a reflexive roll to resist another power is not. Perception rolls are not necessarily deliberate, but noticing one's surroundings does require a degree of involvement with them, and so such rolls receive a negative modifier equal to the mage's Expression rating. Obviously, characters who cannot hear are exempt from the effects of this spell. Also, the caster has no ability to choose targets -- it affects everyone within earshot. He can warn any allies in the area, of course, enabling them to prepare themselves (casting a Mental Shield, using earplugs, spending Willpower on the resistance roll), but beyond that, the song saddens everyone who hears it.

"Effect":"Sometimes, it isn't enough to have loyal and steadfast living servants. A normal human being, no matter how trustworthy, has the capacity for betrayal. Whether his lips are loosened by seemingly sincere companionship, mystic compulsion, or even torture, he can be induced to fail his master's trust. Where, then, does an enterprising necromancer turn for assistance? Quicken Corpse animates one or more corpses to serve as unfailing, devoted slaves. What such servants lack in wits and motivation, they more than make up for in dogged determination and sheer, tireless pursuit of the tasks they are set. Generally speaking, such ambulatory corpses possess a level of reasoning just above that of a rather intelligent dog. They understand certain visual cues (such as the opening of the door they are meant to guard) and auditory commands (&quot;Defend me!&quot;), but cannot perform feats requiring abstract intellect. They have a limited memory, but cannot make even basic correlations or inferences. (While they can, for example, dimly recall that their master has changed their clothes once a day, they cannot determine that he is likely to do so again tomorrow.) They have no individual initiative. These corpse-slaves are not really any stronger than they were in life, but they are tireless and completely without the ability to sense or respond to pain. They need not eat or sleep and do whatever chore they are set to until told otherwise, even if it requires them to tear their own bodies apart in the attempt. They experience neither fear nor the desire for self-preservation and have no minds, per se, for others to control. They can, however, be wrested away from their master through the casting of this spell by another necromancer. Only one success is required to animate a corpse. Additional successes determine the strength of the mage's control. Someone attempting to wrest control of the walking dead with another casting of this spell must exceed the original caster's successes. Additional success can instead be used to boost the corpse's Physical (but not Mental or Social) traits, at a rate of one success per additional dot in any trait.</P><BR>",

Thus, enterprising Moros strive to think of new and better ways in which to allow animated corpses to mend their own injuries. When cast upon a zombie, this spell enables the zombie to feed upon other dead flesh to mend its injuries and creates in it a compulsion to do so when reduced below a certain number of health boxes (determined by the caster). When reduced below this level and presented with any source of dead flesh, the zombie will feed, consuming one level of the corpse's Size over the course of five turns and regaining one health box, until such time as the zombie is restored to at least the appropriate level of health programmed into the zombie by the caster.

"Effect":"The mage severs a soul from a Sleeper. While the soul is separated from the body, the subject suffers all the normal afflictions of soullessness. The mage must touch the target for the entirety of the spellcasting. If he loses contact, he loses all accumulated successes. (With Death 5, he can cast this spell at sensory range. The spell cannot be cast sympathetically.) Needless to say, the victim must be rendered incapable of moving or escaping for the full length of the spellcasting. Relying on a grappling hold for a conscious victim is unwise, since the victim gets a chance to throw off the hold each turn, while it might take hours to complete the extended casting. The target number is equal to the subject's Willpower. Only a limited number of rolls are allowed for the caster, however, before his attempt is deemed a success or failure. A number of rolls may be made equal to his Resolve + Composure. If the spell fails, it cannot be recast on the same target until at least one day (24 hours) has passed. A reflexive and contested Resolve roll is made for the target against each of the spellcaster's rolls. If the target's rolls succeed at any point during the extended casting, the casting fails. While the soul is free of its body, it exists in Twilight. The mage who severed the soul can see and touch the Twilight soul. Mages who use this dread magic usually store their soul bounty in a Soul Jar to prevent its escape. A soul can be restored using Spirit 3 (Restore Lost Soul), and it can be protected with Prime 4 (Armor of the Soul) and reclaimed with Fate 4 (Destroy Bindings).

A mage may increase the Durability of the wall by 2 or the length of the wall by three feet (maximum of 12 feet long) for each additional success beyond the first. A mage with four successes on the casting roll (for example) could create a six-foot-long, Durability 6 wall. Regardless of length, the wall continues in a straight line. If the wall intersects with a solid object, the wall ends at that object, and any additional length is lost.

The physical symptoms of death, other than decomposition, set in (the onset and passing of rigor mortis, the receding of the gums and the skin of the scalp and fingertips, the pooling of blood at the bottom of the body).

Only one success is required to animate a corpse and instill it with a Passion. Additional successes are added to the target number to boost the revenant's traits, at a rate of one success per additional dot of any trait.

"Effect":"One of the most vicious direct mystic assaults known to the Awakened world, Rotting Flesh rends and destroys the physical form of a living being, riddling it with corruption and putrefaction. This assault is brutally effective, but is the metaphysical equivalent of using a club rather than a scalpel. Flesh corrodes and rots, bones twist, crack and turn to ash, and blood thickens with globs of corrupted tissue and rivulets of pus. While each component of this assault, taken on its own, looks to be perhaps some effect of natural decay, taken together, they cannot be mistaken for anything but unnatural. Certainly, any that witness such a spell know the magic for what it is, as the victim is afflicted with the rot of the grave. The mage must first grab hold of the target, with a roll of Strength or Dexterity + Brawl - the target's Defense. If successful, he can cast this spell as an instant action in the following turn. (With Death 5, he can cast this spell at sensory range as an instant action. He needs Death 6 before he can add Space 2 for a sympathetic casting.) Each success inflicts one Health point of lethal damage to the target. With Death 5, the mage can inflict aggravated damage instead with the expenditure of one Mana. In addition, each success levies a -1 die penalty on all the victim's Social rolls, due to the horrible appearance (and stench) of his wounds.

Instead, he becomes a mass of incorporeal shadows, retaining his human shape. He may remain three-dimensional (though still without apparent mass or substance) or change into a two-dimensional form. While in either form, he may move up to his normal Speed, though the latter shape can only move by clinging to walls and floors; without recourse to other magic, he cannot move on ceilings or otherwise defy the force of gravity, though he can slip under doors, through cracks, or other spaces too thin for a normal person to move through, provided that any unsealed seam exists. The character is effectively invisible in areas of either normal or supernatural darkness and can see perfectly well in either, though he is not blinded or in any way discomfited by sunlight (save for the possibility of Disbelief on the part of Sleepers who witness a disembodied shadow moving under its own power and quite possibly against the direction of the light.) The mage's Attributes and other characteristics remain the same, though he cannot make any physical attacks (any that require touch with a hand, a weapon, or a unit of ammunition) while in this form, but may, himself, be attacked normally. The caster may alter his Size when casting this spell, as per the systems given under the Life 4 Shapechanging spell for doing so. By adding Matter 4 to the casting, the mage can cause all of his normal equipment (such as clothing, a cellular phone or a handgun) to change into shadow with him, though they retain no distinct properties; the phone neither makes nor receives calls and the gun cannot be used to fire bullets, for example.</P><BR>",

As soon as his heart stops, he continues his crusade -- he might not even have time to hit the floor before his new incarnation soldiers on. As one of the walking dead, his actions depend on inflexible passions instead of genuine human feelings. This spell is a prepared version of the &quot;Revenant&quot; spell. The mage must cast the spell ahead of time. Once cast, the spell can be activated with an instant action. At that point, the spell kills the mage instantly (using a voluntarily permanent version of Suppress Own Life that painlessly causes physical and spiritual death) and turns him into a revenant. Determine the revenant's Passions and other traits at the time of casting, not activation. This spell doesn't work if the mage isn't willing to die; the component that slays the mage isn't strong enough to overcome the psychic resistance he might muster by having second thoughts (though a Death 5 variant allows this). The character suffers real (and barring the intervention of an archmaster) irrevocable death. The spell is essentially a form of suicide, used when a mage is cornered, wounded, and will not prevail in his current state. Storytellers and players should ensure that the character really is ready to die. If there's any question about this, a Resolve + Composure roll might help determine whether his will could really trump his survival instincts.

It was a defense mechanism; the Moros Awakening taught him that honing his body, meditating and studying another culture meant nothing. He'd be food for worms in the end. With his penchant for wearing tabi (&quot;socks&quot;) and carrying around a sword bag, he'd be a figure of mockery, if not for the fact that sword in the bag is real and he's used it to behead two mages and one woman he mistook for one. Erik based his spell on the philosophies of Hagakure, a Japanese text that extols the virtues of suicide for one's lord. He believes that he's serving Sleepers as a whole and should be ready to lay down his life at any time, so he casts this spell periodically so that, in the event of being critically wounded or trapped, he can die and will his remains to continue.

"Effect":"Rumors of the Awakened raising the dead are partly true. A mage with the right knowledge really can return a dead person to life. But the mage cannot cheat death without giving something in return -- himself. With this spell, the mage gives up his own life, and dies so that another might live, and more than this, so that the other might Awaken. Although the casting of the spell is described here as &quot;instant,&quot; the time it takes a mage to prepare to cast the spell can be lengthy, as the caster will sometimes set up an appointment with the Reaper -- perhaps creating the circumstances that will allow a crazed enemy to take one final, fatal shot, perhaps subconsciously exposing himself to a disease or a poison. The corpse of the person whom the mage wants to raise must be intact, meaning that the body can't have begun to decay. Also, the subject cannot have died of old age -- the subject must have had an untimely death, from disease, violence, or an accident. If the spell succeeds, the subject returns to life with all her Health dots, Attributes, Skills, and Advantages intact. The mage who cast the spell dies. How he dies depends upon the circumstances he has created. In effect, fate takes a hand in his demise. A sniper's bullet finds his temple at the moment the other arises. A terrible car accident claims his life, seconds after the spell is complete. His heart gives way to a congenital defect and he collapses, as the subject of the spell opens her eyes. The price of this spell cannot be avoided. The Reaper can't be tricked. It's a life for a life; that's the deal. The soul of the Tamer of the Cave who cast this spell vanishes. The soul cannot be retrieved, and the Saint cannot be revived by any means. The subject of the spell, meanwhile, Awakens. She doesn't awaken immediately. It could be days, weeks, months or years down the line. But she does Awaken. It could be that this is where the mage's soul goes: it enters the body of the person the mage wanted to raise, joining with her and making her a mage. Given that this spell can only ever be cast once by any given mage, it has never been formalized as a rote.</P><BR>",

"Aspect":"Vulgar",

"Effect":"Deathlike Journey severs a mage's soul and grants it a body of ephemera. This body appears to be a ghost to anyone who does not inspect its aura. The ghost is drawn into the Underworld. In ghostly form, the mage cannot travel to other parts of the Realms Invisible without finding some special path or conduit. The subject of the spell uses his normal traits, but cannot make use of equipment. While the mage journeys in ghostly form, his body appears to be dead; his life signs and aura are absent. Unlike many spells of this type, the mage's soul is truly absent from his body. Thus, the subject of the spell should ensure that his body is protected against possession and other forms of tampering. Life magic prevents the body from decaying or suffering similar ill effects (such as damage due to oxygen starvation) throughout the spell's duration. If the mage's body is killed, he almost always becomes a ghost, but remains in the Underworld instead of moving into Twilight near an anchor. Mages normally use this spell to uncover the secrets of the dead. Unfortunately, some force (perhaps just the trauma of the magic, but inherent to the laws of death) distorts the mage's perceptions, so that separating the reality of ghostly experiences from metaphors and visions becomes difficult. Ultimately, the Storyteller decides which parts of the mage's journey were literal experiences and which parts were visions, but all parts normally have symbolic significance. They may represent the distorted forms of strange entities the mage encountered, waypoints that no human eye can truly describe, or prophecies gleaned from the ravings of the ancient dead. For example, mages have boasted of finding Atlantis within the Underworld, but this could be anything from a genuine echo of the Awakened City to a personal vision. Nevertheless, the ghosts and writings the mage encounters there may well pass on genuine knowledge. Alternately, the traveler might encounter a dead lover who knows an obscure spell, even though he was a Sleeper throughout his life.</P><BR>",

Savvy mages should expect the average ghost or spirit to display only minimal loyalty and cooperation, except where their own interests converge with those of the discarnate entities they've gifted with physical forms. The most loyal homunculi created in this manner are generally the ghosts of slain cabal members, who use their flawed new forms to further the collective goals they fought for while alive. The Death version of this spell targets ghosts, while its Spirit equivalent works on spirits. This spell is treated as a finishing spell. Any of the substitute relinquishment costs for Enchanted Items may be applied to it. Similar to a finishing spell, Secret Marriage can't be dispelled, only temporarily suppressed. While suppressed, the entity remains within the homunculus but is unable to animate it in any way, including the use of speech. If this spell is cast with a limited Duration, the ghost or spirit departs the homunculus body when the spell expires. The empty, inanimate homunculus may be reused, housing either the same ghost or spirit or a new volunteer.</P><BR>",

"Effect":"The mage rips soul from body and possesses the target's now-vacant form, leaving the victim and the mage's former body dead. The spell is a means of prolonging life and also of obtaining a newer, younger, fitter body. Some mages also see it as an opportunity to experiment: Obtaining a body of a different sex, race, or the like in order to see how &quot;the other half&quot; lives (and dies, for that matter). The mage can cast this spell on a given target only once. If the spell fails, that target is forever immune to any further casting by that mage (although not by others). The mage obtains the subject's Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina, and any physical Merits or Flaws, retaining all other traits. The subject's spirit is destroyed although, at the Storyteller's discretion, the spirit may survive as a ghost (and likely a vengeful one at that).</P><BR>",

"Effect":"The mage steals years of life from a Sleeper to extend his own life. Each person is allotted a set span of years, a single thread of existence that is snipped with each passing year, the thread growing shorter and shorter. A person's actions in life can fray the thread or stretch it. This spell allows a mage to snip a portion of a Sleeper's thread and sew it to his own. This spell cannot be cast upon supernatural beings, including the Awakened. The target number of successes equals the number of years sought from the target, although the mage may not steal more years with a single casting than his total dots in Death. The mage can cast this spell on the same target only once a year. This effect is largely in the hands of the Storyteller. It is a means mages can use to live beyond a normal mortal life span, although it does not prevent the effects of aging nor death by calamity.</P><BR>",

"Effect":"Mages who wish to learn the some of the strangest secrets of death sometimes discover this spell when perusing ancient grimoires in some of the oldest Awakened libraries in the world. Concealed within its arcane formulae is a summoning spell intended to call to the material realm one of the dread and alien chthonians. In order to summon a chthonian, a willworker must accrue five successes per desired effective spirit Rank of the entity: Five successes for a Rank 1 chthonian, for instance, or 20 for a creature of Rank 4. Further, two points of Mana must be spent in the casting for each Rank of the chthonian. This spell is not contested as chthonians appear to lack the wherewithal to resist a summons to the material realm (though they are perfectly capable of contesting any other magics directed at them once they are present). As specified, above, a summoned chthonian exists in the immaterial state of Twilight and cannot materialize, by any means. Further, no matter what steps are taken, the entity always returns to the Underworld at the next new moon, if not released (whether by the cast or under its own power) before such a time.</P><BR>",

The Underworld is a dread place where, according to most mages, ghosts without anchors are banished. The caster can use other spells to compel the ghost to manifest, or can provide ectoplasm for its manifestation. This spell is most often cast to learn the secrets of the long-departed, such as the locations of lost treasures or the existence of lost heirs. The mage can ask one question of the ghost per success. After it has answered it departs, returning to the Underworld. (The mage cannot delay for more than five turns between questions, or else the ghost departs.) The entity's answers are truthful and straightforward, although if a question is not clear and concise, the ghost might misinterpret it and give a misleading answer.</P><BR>",
