		"Effect" : "In one of the most basic spells of Santer&iacute;a, an Awakened santero can call down one of the orishas and allow the deity to possess him. The orisha can then use its powers through the mage's body, dispense godly wisdom or, unfortunately, wreak punishment on anyone who happens to offend it. Although this rite is considered a sacred act as well as a useful practice, santeros do understand that they risk their lives by trucking with the orishas. But, characteristically, they realize that if they should die while being ridden by an orisha, they have become a great ebb&oacute;. Some traditions even hold that if someone dies while being ridden by an orisha, that person can become an orisha. The mage dances a bembe, and he must be accompanied by ritual drums. Often, other santeros dance with him, and this ritual usually follows an ebb&oacute;. The mage continues to dance until his mind and body are overwhelmed by the exertion of the bembe and the drums, and the orisha enters him. In game terms, the player must accumulate a number of successes equal to the mage's Stamina + Resolve, and if the character possesses the Iron Stamina  Merit, those dots are also added to the target number of successes. Each roll equates one minute of dancing, and the player can only make a number of rolls equal to the mage's Stamina + Athletics (after which the mage is too exhausted to dance properly). Once the player has accumulated the proper number of successes, the orisha possesses the mage. At this point, the mage begins to behave like the orisha in question. Osain limps and leans on a walking stick. Chang&oacute; is lusty and belligerent, while Osh&uacute;n is flirtatious. The orishas demand their tribute -- many of them try to take bites of the raw flesh of the ritual sacrifice, and all must have their special foods and items (see Foci), or else they depart and the spell ends. While the mage is being possessed, the orisha speaks and acts through him. The other santeros present can ask the orisha for advice or intercession. If any are Awakened, they can ask the orisha for magical understanding (this can be used to justify an increase in Gnosis or Arcana ratings), even learning rotes from the orisha. Occasionally, a mage channels one of the warlike orishas (Chang&oacute;, Ogg&uacute;n, Eleggu&aacute;, Ochosi, or Oy&aacute;) to help him fight in an upcoming battle. The game effects of this possession vary depending on the Storyteller's decision of what the orishas are and what role they fulfill in the chronicle. In general, this spell allows an effect similar to Coaxing the Spirits (Spirit 1), but with farther-reaching effects. The mage receives a number of bonus dice to a given task based on how satisfied the orisha is with the sacrifice, the items offered to it, and the bembe the mage performed (the Storyteller should take all of this into consideration and then make a roll for the player, probably Manipulation + Socialize, and use the successes for the bonus dice). These dice can be used on any roll that the task involves, but the player does not know how many he has to work with (just as the mage doesn't know how far the orisha's influence will carry him). At some point, the capricious orisha's attention fades, and the mage is on his own again.</P><BR>",

He may either call one or more spirits personally known to him, or he may specify any type of spirit of his choosing (tree spirits or bird spirits, for example), or even send out a general summons to all spirits within his range (by spending one Mana; the closest spirit responds). The spirit comes to the caster with as much speed as it can muster, although it cannot be made to go farther than the maximum distance it is allowed to travel from its anchor. The call may be a gentle request for audience or it may be an irresistible compulsion, at the mage's discretion. Many spirits do not appreciate being called in the latter fashion, though some are too mindless to care and others may actually esteem the mage's boldness in demanding their presence in so unhesitating a manner. A curious spirit usually answers a general call or personal summons, but a reflexive and contested roll is made if it does not wish to respond.

				"Rote Description" : "This rote provides a modern refashioning of the ceremonies at Eleusis, particularly those that initiated a participant into the Eleusinian Mysteries. In the Greek rites of old, the cultists drank from a heady entheogenic brew of what was believed to be barley, water, and pennyroyal (a slightly toxic variety of strong mint). Honey was often added for flavor, and the modern version has it, as well. Some speculate that the entheogen of the brew came from empurpled barley, whose color was granted by the psychoactive ergot fungus that grew upon it. Others believe it the combination of the toxic mint and the fermentation of the brew contributed toward visions. Here, modern participants of this ritual add their own hallucinogen - most prefer to add something natural (mushrooms, extract of ayahuasca, peyote), but some will add synthetics like LSD or lab-DMT to the brew. The drink provides the first focus of the rote, and to a point, the hallucinogen in the drink is the second focus. Participants must gulp, not sip, the brew. The third focus is a copy of one of Homer's books: Likely The Iliad or The Odyssey, though the anonymous (but oft-attributed to him) Homeric Hymns work just as well. The caster must read from random passages from the text. The nature of the passages matters little. The simple repetition of these ancient words is believed to form a conduit between past, present and future through which the gods can travel. (Note that some mages set a conditional duration upon this spell for the sake of safety. That condition is met when the Homeric text is closed. With the clap of the book's closing, the &quot;god&quot; is banished.) Note that this rote does not have a condition of environment (it can be performed anywhere, whether in the middle of a circle of stones or in a dark attic strewn with old toys), but it does have a temporal condition. It must be performed at dawn or dusk; at any other time, the rote fails. Improvised casting has no such restrictions."

Unless it grows to become at least rank 3, it acts only in accordance with its simple nature and does not usually do anything that is not directly related to its Influence. A baseball bat wants to be used to hit things and a bomb shelter wants to protect people. An object can be interviewed about its former owner, although its knowledge may be limited to only those times it was actually used for its purpose (a knife used to cut, a hammer to drive nails). A roused object has an ephemeral presence in Twilight. If it is destroyed in the material world, its ephemeral presence is thrust across the Gauntlet into the Shadow Realm, where it continues to linger for a while before it goes dormant again.

One person or spirit of Size 5 or less can walk the road per turn (larger beings can spend two turns walking it). Each success added to the target number allows the mage to widen the road so that one additional person can walk it per turn. The road remains for one hour. Note that the caster cannot limit who can use the road; nearby enemies can attempt to walk it. A person can be thrown forcibly through the Gauntlet onto the road. He must first be grabbed in a grapple action, after which the grappler can shove him onto the road as an overpower maneuver. With Spirit 4, this spell can be cast with a prolonged Duration.

In most cases, the mage will require a spirit that can manifest in an embodied form to perform its service (typically as a horse, though a camel, a dolphin, or even a motorcycle might be more appropriate in some cases). To acquire the service of an embodied spirit, the mage must achieve four successes. If there's no need for the spirit to be capable of manifesting - if, for instance, the mage is capable of assuming a Twilight state - the target number is reduced to three. Embodied spirits will not lose Essence during the Duration of the spell; they typically move at a speed appropriate for their form, but are not limited by fatigue, hunger, fear of predators, etc. The speed of a spirit in Twilight will depend on its type. A wise mage carefully considers the type of spirit she needs when making her initial search or summons, knowing that the more specific traits she seeks, the harder it may be to find a suitable steed. A spirit that serves once may tell the mage its name, if it's been well treated and/or rewarded, making it easier to find for future castings of this spell. The spell can be cast in conjunction with Fate 2 and Space 2, in which case the spirit's service is deferred until some specific circumstance occurs - typically, when the mage calls out for the spirit - at which point it will arrive on the scene within one turn.

		"Effect" : "The mage invites or compels a spirit to inhabit an object and lend its powers to that object in the form of a fetish. Such beings (for those who care about such things) often wish to be placed within an object somehow appropriate to their nature, and grant use of their Numina to whomever holds the object in question. Thus, a fire-spirit may inhabit a dagger of obsidian, or a healing-spirit could possess a container meant for holding water. The spirit still uses its own Essence to fuel its powers and can lapse into slumber if overtaxed. A spirit forced into a fetish rails to be set free, cries that can be heard by any with active Spirit senses. The spirit must be bound into a material object. The spell's target number equals the spirit's Rank. The mage must first find a suitable spirit, usually by seeking one out, calling out to it, or summoning it from the Shadow Realm. A spirit's suitability depends on what the mage wants the fetish to do. If he wants to shoot fiery arrows at his enemies or simply make a portable heater, he needs a fire spirit. Binding a water spirit does not allow him to ignite his arrows or warm him on cold nights. Finding an appropriate subject often involves researching a spirit to make sure it can do what the mage wants -- or that it can do what it says it can. Study usually involves an occult library or past training on the subject. If the Storyteller feels it necessary, he can require an Intelligence + Academics or Occult roll for the mage to properly identify a suitable spirit. The spirit releases its Numina only upon the fetish's activation; it sleeps the rest of the time. The user must request or command the spirit to act whenever he seeks its power. This is done non-verbally with an instant action Gnosis + Spirit roll. Success allows the mage to use the fetish for the following scene. Failure means the spirit remains asleep. A dramatic failure means the spirit is angered and does not respond for at least the next scene. The spirit's powers do not invoke Paradoxes or Disbelief. Spirits are native to the Fallen World and do not invoke the same reactions as Supernal magic. If a fetish's material object is ever destroyed, the spirit is released and becomes a Twilight being. If it has the proper Numina, it can escape back into the Shadow Realm on its own. Otherwise, it is trapped in Twilight until it can find a Verge or a mage (or other supernatural being) to help it pass over.</P><BR>",

For a mind untempered by exposure to Le Livre Rouge, facing one's foulest desires and inner corruption is unsettling at best. By casting this rote, a mage calls into being a goetic demon of her target, similar to the manner in which the spell Goetic Evocation functions. This spell may be cast at sensory range. The demon is an ephemeral entity that initially exists only in Twilight. The ephemeral demon is Rank 1 and begins play with Essence 4 (10 max). The demon's Attributes are determined by the Attributes of the target. Power is equal to half the target's highest Attribute rating (round up) in either Intelligence, Strength, or Presence. Finesse and Resistance are calculated in the same manner based on Wits, Dexterity, and Manipulation, or Resolve, Stamina and Composure, respectively. The demon possesses Influence: Sin 2 (the Vice of the target) and the Numina: Materialize and Fetter. While in Twilight, the demon lurks nearby the target it was created from and uses its Influence to tempt the target into giving in to her Vice. Each time the target gives in to her Vice she gains no Willpower; instead the demon gains 3 Essence. When the demon reaches full Essence it uses its Materialize Numina to punch through the Gauntlet and its Fetter Numina to anchor itself. If the demon is unable to anchor itself to a Fetter before the duration of this spell ends, it discorporates and is unraveled. If the demon succeeds in anchoring itself to a fetter it begins to Materialize as a near-clone of the target. Close associates of the target may realize the demon isn't who it is mimicking with a single success on a Wits + Empathy roll. While materialized, the demon attempts to cause as much havoc as possible (paying special attention to its target's Vice), before retreating to the area of its fetter. The target of the spell then has to deal with the consequences of the demon's actions, which can range from annoying to deadly serious. Demons can maintain themselves indefinitely in Twilight (long after the duration of the original spell has lapsed) after they succeed at creating a fetter. As a result, the only sure way to be rid of the demon is to destroy its fetter. When the fetter is destroyed, the demon is unraveled just as if it had failed to fetter itself during the initial duration of the spell. If attacked, demons reform after being violently discorporated in the same way as normal spirits.</P><BR>",

Every two additional successes can give the demon one extra Numina. The demon can use its Influence to seduce someone into acting out the demon's Vice (which is not necessarily the victim's own), succumbing to its derangement, or falling prey to its psychological Flaw (depending on the type of demon summoned). If the demon's Vice is the same as the victim's, the victim is not rewarded the usual Willpower point for acting out the Vice -- the demon gets this point instead, although he doesn't have to act out the Vice himself (and hence, doesn't get the blame). The demon follows the mage's orders, although if the mage himself engages his personal Vice, derangement or Flaw while this spell is in effect, the demon is freed from control and turns its attentions to corrupting the mage. Casting this spell is an act of hubris, requiring a mage with a Wisdom higher than 4 dots to make a degeneration roll. The demon's ephemeral form remains for one hour.</P><BR><BR>",

		"Effect" : "The mage meditates at a powerful Hallow, reaching across the Abyss to the Supernal Realm of her Awakening, and calls forth one of the dragons. To do so, the character must speak in the tongue of the dragons (which is one reason that Llana does not allow non-members of the Disciples of the World Dragon to witness this spell in progress). The mage is free to request a specific dragon, but any dragon can use the path thus created. The dragon rides the pathway through the Abyss and into the Fallen World, emerging from the Hallow to speak with the mage. The target number of successes is determined as follows. The base is 10 successes. Add one success for every point of the Hallow's rating below five (so a one-dot Hallow adds four successes to the required total). Add one success if the resonance of the Hallow is directly opposed to the Realm that the mage is trying to reach (Storyteller's discretion). Add one success if the character is trying to call on a specific dragon. Add one success if the dragon in question is unlikely to be found in the Realm that the mage is trying to reach (again, Storyteller's discretion). This spell costs 10 Mana to cast. The mage can draw the Mana from the Hallow, from his own pool, or he can add any Mana he does not wish to pay as successes to the target number. If the spell succeeds, the Hallow splits open and a dragon appears. Thus far, no dragon thus summoned has ever attacked the summoner, though Llana maintains that it could happen if the spell were cast improperly. The dragon can give the character information about whatever topic she might desire, especially news and descriptions of the Supernal Realms, new rotes, or weaknesses and powers of Abyssal creatures. The dragon always tells the cast to &quot;find the World Dragon,&quot; however.</P><BR>",

The homunculus gains whatever Mental and Social Skills the Storyteller feels are appropriate for the type of spirit or ghost (if any), along with any Flaws and/or derangements. Any supernatural powers arising from their status as discarnate entities are unavailable to them while in homunculus form. While some ghosts and spirits crave the ability to operate in the Material Realm conveyed by possession of a homunculus form, they generally feel this way because they want to pursue a specific agenda of some kind. Savvy mages should expect the average ghost or spirit to display only minimal loyalty and cooperation, except where their own interests converge with those of the discarnate entities they've gifted with physical forms. The most loyal homunculi created in this manner are generally the ghosts of slain cabal members, who use their flawed new forms to further the collective goals they fought for while alive. The Death version of this spell targets ghosts, while its Spirit equivalent works on spirits. This spell is treated as a finishing spell. Any of the substitute relinquishment costs for Enchanted Items may be applied to it. Similar to a finishing spell, Secret Marriage can't be dispelled, only temporarily suppressed. While suppressed, the entity remains within the homunculus but is unable to animate it in any way, including the use of speech. If this spell is cast with a limited Duration, the ghost or spirit departs the homunculus body when the spell expires. The empty, inanimate homunculus may be reused, housing either the same ghost or spirit or a new volunteer.</P><BR>",

If creating a spirit, successes buy dots of Rank, Attributes, Influence, and Numina for the being on a one-for-one basis. Similarly, changing a spirit (adding to, altering, or subtracting from its Attributes) requires the mage to devote one success per dot to the trait to be added or changed. A mage cannot create a spirit of a greater Rank than the lesser of his Spirit Arcanum or Gnosis. Nor can he advance an extant spirit beyond such a degree or alter one of a Rank greater than the lesser of his Spirit Arcanum or Gnosis. The mage must be familiar with the powers with which he works. That is, he must have studied a spirit who already has those powers before he can imbue them into a spirit. At the Storyteller's discretion, an occult library might hold enough information to allow a mage an Intelligence + Academics roll to understand the forces before he begins casting. When the spell's Duration expires, the spirit ceases to exist (if it was created) or reverts back to its natural state (if it was modified).

Spirits of lesser Rank than the mage seek (or may be persuaded) to attach themselves to her court, and she is treated with the respect, honor, and dignity due one of her station. Of course, the mage is expected to uphold the dictates and etiquette of the spirit courts (meaning she had best be thoroughly conversant in them) and may herself be offered a position within the court of a still more powerful entity. When calling, controlling, binding, or otherwise using sympathetic magic upon members of her court, the mage may cast spells as though a spirit were in Intimate sympathetic contact with her, without need of the Space Arcanum. Thus, she can easily heal one of her courtiers, regardless of where it is, but could not cast an offensive spell at other spirits through her subject without an appropriate Space component. Any spiritual alliances the mage makes are rendered null and void when the spell expires (at least, spirits don't uphold their end of any bargains, though many continue to expect the willworker to fulfill her outstanding obligations). The willworker is expected to support, protect, and advise her vassals (and they are expected to do the same for her).</P><BR>",

		"Effect" : "Since the most ancient times, mages have aspired to commune with the gods. Indeed, in ancient Atlantis, the Ladder to Heaven was constructed for the very purpose of conversing with the powers that moved (and were, in turn moved by) the most expansive processes of the cosmos. The Celestial Ladder is gone, but beings still dwell within the Fallen World possessed of such immense power as to be considered divinities in their own right. Masters of the Spirit Arcanum who wish to have contact with such entities make use of this spell to do so. Successful casting of this spell summons a royal avatar to the mage's location. Because of the transcendent nature of spirits of Rank 6 or greater, no Space Arcanum component is necessary to contact the spirit; it simply knows that it is being contacted and either chooses to extrude an avatar or not. If the spirit is unwilling to speak with the summoner, then the spell automatically fails, regardless of successes accrued and Mana spent. Successes equal to five times the avatar's effective spirit Rank (of 5) are necessary to build the ephemeral shell to be inhabited by a fragment of the royal's consciousness and power. The caster has no control, whatsoever, over the final Traits of the royal avatar; the royal assigns them, instead, according to its wishes. If, at any point, the royal wishes to terminate contact with the summoner, the spell automatically ends, with no roll necessary. Should the royal wish to communicate directly with the willworker, then it may simply shift the totality of its presence to the mage's location, though such is surpassingly rare. Not only do most spirit royals have no inclination to deal so directly with mortals, but the unscheduled arrival of so potent a being can inflict disastrous incidental consequences on the local Shadow and material realms. Further, entities of equal or greater standing to the royal may view such a move as an infringement against territorial boundaries and retaliate accordingly. Casting this spell is an act of hubris, requiring any mage with four or more dots of Wisdom to roll three dice against degeneration.</P><BR>",
