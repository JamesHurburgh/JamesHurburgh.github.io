In many cases, various Mage Sights can be of help in detecting these strange Resonances, but, sometimes, a little something more is called for. Bizarre entities from outside of the weave of the realms (such as those discussed in Chapter Four) don't usually think like those from any of the known worlds; their thoughts are alien even to the monstrous Gulmoth or the strangest Supernal Demon. These incomprehensible imaginings stain the Tapestry by their passing, leaving a trail that can be followed by one who knows how to look. By casting this spell, the mage gains a sense for the unusual thought patterns that seep out of these beings, to leach into the Fallen World. Depending upon the particular qualities (and power) of the creature in question, its thoughts can leave metaphysical marks that linger for hours, or even days. By way of this spell, a willworker might learn, roughly, what such a being was feeling when it passed through an area (if, indeed, it is capable of any emotions analogous to those experienced by humans), what it was doing at that time, in which direction it was moving, and whether it is close by.</P><BR>",

Someone -- word was, a Tremere lich -- got her hands on a weird polyhedral box that some said could only be opened from the inside by one who was outside of it. Whatever the case, she figured out how to unlock the thing and a small horde of skittering things poured out of it from Elsewhere. Robert Baron, local leader of the Guardians of the Veil, however, happened to be a quick thinker, with a bit of experience summoning unpleasant things from worlds without names, and he recognized the telltale signs of alien entities. No one is rightly sure if he already knew this spell when he went on the hunt; if he didn't, though, he certainly came up with it with suspicious alacrity. Reluctantly, Baron taught his rote to as many mages as he needed to curb the infestation, and then he vanished inexplicably at its conclusion."

(Experience may not teach a mage the distinction between a cockroach's mind and a dung beetle's, but it does tell her the difference between an insect and reptile mind.) The mage detects the general type of mind she senses (a ghost, disembodied consciousness or spirit, for example) and this sense is useful for helping the mage to know when she is spied upon or just watched by a being currently lurking in refined dimensions.

Note that this spell does not ensure that the character will sleep well, only that her mind and body needs less time than usual to awake refreshed. This spell cannot be used consecutively within the same week more times than the mage's rating in the Mind Arcanum.</P><BR>",

The drawback of this spell is that an attacker protected by a Mental Shield spell might see through Misperception's illusions with a reflexive and contested Gnosis + Mind roll.

In other words, the target would still gain any bonuses and suffer any penalties from the hallucination. However, a drug test would reveal no psychoactives in the target's system.

For example, if a mage has Intelligence 3 and Mind 3 and three successes are achieved on this spell to boost his Intelligence, that trait becomes six dots for the spell's Duration. If four successes were rolled, he could still only boost Intelligence by three dots, since he has only Mind 3.

In addition, the target's Willpower cannot exceed 10 dots, no matter how high his Resolve and/or Composure is boosted with this spell. Example: Arethusa uses Augment the Mind to boost her Resolve. She gets two successes on the casting, adding two dots to her Resolve. This also adds two dots to her Willpower. She does not, however, gain two extra Willpower points. Note that the same spell cast to boost a different Mental or Social Attribute does not combine with the first spell -- only the highest Potency spell takes effect. For example, if a mage boosts his Intelligence by two dots and then casts a spell boosting his Wits by one dot, only the first spell applies, since it has the higher Potency.

Would-be attackers look at the mage and find themselves psychologically incapable of attacking her in any manner. They can attempt to block the mage's path, but cannot attempt to harm her in any way. This spell works equally well on humans, animals and supernatural beings, but has no effect on any sort of automatic defense or anything completely mindless. In addition, this spell is insufficiently powerful to overcome the target's survival instinct. As a result, it functions only as long as the mage does nothing to directly threaten the target's safety. Record the number of successes the mage rolls on this spell. If a character who attempts to attack the mage has a Resolve score lower than the number of successes the mage rolled, then this individual cannot attack the mage. If the character's Resolve is higher than the number of successes rolled, then each success the mage rolled acts as 1 point of armor that is applied to all attacks on the mage made by the target. This armor comes from the attacker struggling to overcome the residual compulsion not to harm the mage. If the mage attacks a character or otherwise directly threatens a character's safety or the safety of someone close to him, he is then free to attack the mage, but still treats the number of successes the mage rolled as armor. In effect, the character is now treated as if his Resolve was higher than the number of successes the mage rolled. A mage using this spell can yell at people or berate them, but if she draws a weapon in a threatening manner or orders an associate to attack someone, then that person is free to attack the mage. If the mage actively threatens a number of people at once, such as by brandishing a gun in their general direction, they are all free to attack the mage. By spending 1 Mana, the duration of this spell can be made to last for 1 day. Many mages who use this spell cast it at the beginning of the day, as part of their morning rituals.</P><BR>",

Targets who fail to resist the spell must make a reflexive Resolve + Composure roll to avoid acting on their Vice when an opportunity presents itself, regardless of whether it would be ethical or socially appropriate to do so. If the victim fails the Resolve + Composure roll he must act within a few turns of the opportunity arising. He may use this time to minimize the possible consequences. The spell affects not only the initial target, but a number of people indicated by the spell's Target factor within its sympathetic range factor. The spell affects targets in order of their sympathetic connection. This is based on the target's sympathetic bonds, not the caster's (unless the caster inflicts the spell on himself). It is difficult for this spell to provoke truly heinous acts. If indulging the Vice would force a Morality (or the equivalent for mages and other supernatural beings) check, the victim gains bonus dice on the Resolve + Composure roll equal to half the difference between the character's Morality and the minimum Morality required to force a check, rounded down. For example, a character with a Morality of 7 who's in danger of committing a Morality 4 sin adds a die to his roll, while a character with a Morality of 5 who's tempted to commit the same sin because of the spell gains no bonus.</P><BR>",

The spell reinforces the human mind's tendency to interpret unexpected sensory input according to familiar patterns. The spell is most often used to reduce the chances of a Paradox. The Sleeping witness interprets any overtly supernatural occurrence, whether generated by magic or by unnatural beings such as vampires or werewovles, as perfectly ordinary, if perhaps unlikely. Bizarre coincidences are written off to the vagaries of statistical chance. Lights in the sky become weather balloons. That car didn't rise up from the highway and take flight on its own; they must be filming a movie nearby or something. Sleepers under the influence of this spell cannot trigger Disbelief. They're not seeing a crazy, credulity-straining event; they're perceiving an equivalent occurrence that fits snugly within a materialist, logical worldview. When checking for Paradox, if all Sleepers who witness a display of vulgar magic are under the influence of this spell, no bonus is applied to the Paradox roll. Covert spells are never seen as Improbable. A dramatic failure on the casting leaves the targeted Sleeper more attuned to the supernatural, increasing the likelihood and severity of potential Paradoxes. A +3 dice modifier is applied to each Paradox roll for the duration of the current scene. Each additional blatantly supernatural event after the first allows the Sleeper a new chance to perceive these events accurately. A new contested roll occurs; if the Sleeper breaks the spell, the Sleeper not only sees the new event accurately, but reinterprets all previous ones as supernatural.

There are so many celebrities now, in so many fields, that it's impossible to keep track of them. A clever magician can use this to his own advantage, creating in the people he meets the rather unsettling sensation that the man standing before them is famous, and they know him -- if only they could remember what his name was. The mage gets preferential treatment. The best table in the restaurant. Front-of-the-line entry into the club without being on the guest list. He gets to misbehave -- within reason -- and given a lot more slack than a nobody would get. They indulge his eccentric behavior. He receives the perks of being famous without any of the trouble. Having said that, overuse of this spell can be risky. Conning the world into thinking you're famous is one thing, but having your picture taken while you're about your mystic business is quite another. Part of the effect of this spell is to make the target slightly star-struck. A target who's less likely to be impressed by a minor celebrity -- a cynical Hollywood agent, for example -- might get a bonus to his contesting dice pool of one to three dice. Likewise, casting False Fame on someone from a culture in which celebrity isn't a big deal -- a tribal culture in the developing world, for example -- would also give the targets similar bonuses to their dice pools, although in a world where subsistence farmers in rural India own DVD players, people who aren't impressed by celebrities are getting very rare indeed. Dots in the Fame Merit increase the Potency or Target factors of the spell, by one factor for each dot. Dots in the Occultation Merit subtract from the mage's dice pool.</P><BR>",

In most cases, it simply causes the viewer to be far more or less skeptical of this or some specific, related piece of media. This spell can also be used to produce other emotional reactions to specific pieces of media, including anger, belief, or joy. None of these emotions are particularly powerful or complex -- readers or listeners are simply more inclined to feel a certain way about the information. However, if a particularly listener is strongly inclined to feel otherwise about the piece of media, this spell cannot override such a strong conviction. Although the thoughts and emotions produced by this spell only directly affect the target while he is watching or listening to the media containing the subliminal message, the effects of these thoughts and emotions generally linger well beyond the end of the spell. If the mage is using this spell to affect viewers' reactions to a story or rumor other than the one that she is placing the subliminal message in, then the spell becomes more difficult. A closely related story is one on the same topic, such as a specific UFO sighting or a particular fire in a warehouse district. A distantly related story is one that is about UFOs, fires, or the warehouse district in question. Much of the power of this spell comes from the fact that Sleepers are trained to believe in the mass media. While this spell can be used to implant subliminal messages that make Sleepers less likely to disbelieve evidence of magic, impose a one die penalty on any such rolls, because even the mass media has difficulty overcoming the great power of the Abyss.</P><BR>",

		"Effect" : "The mage peers into her subject's mind and forges a connection between one topic and one powerful emotion. For the duration of the spell, the subject's emotions are no longer his own when that topic comes up. The mere mention of the trigger topic might enrage him, delight him, or send him into a downward spiral of depression. While this doesn't give the mage control over the subject, it gives him an edge when the subject is responding to the trigger topic. This is a highly versatile spell, and mages have used it for a variety of purposes, from breaking up relationships, to defending the Veil, to killing enemies. This spell connects one topic of the mage's choosing to a strong basic emotional response in her subject -- anger, joy, shame, sadness, or fear -- and any time that topic comes to the subject's attention, whether in conversation or just through happenstance, it triggers a massive emotional response of the programmed type in the spell's subject. If a topic brings up joy, the subject might not be able to stop talking about it (because doing so brings up such joy). Likewise, discussing other topics might have an equally powerful impact with other feelings. The emotional impulse generated by this spell doesn't give the mage any control over how the subject responds. The spell links one topic with one powerful emotion; the spell does not determine how the subject responds to that emotion. People might grow quiet due to shame, belligerent due to anger, talkative due to joy, detached or morose due to sadness, or nervous and skittish due to fear -- but the mage can't predict with any certainty how any given emotion is going to affect a particular subject. While a mage might expect that a big loud oaf might get violent when he gets angry, and while that's probably the way to bet, the mage can't be sure unless he's familiar with how his subject responds to certain emotional cues. To improve the mage's chances of using this spell effectively, the mage may make an extended Intelligence + Empathy roll to first study the target over time and predict how he is likely to react to a given emotion. The target number is equal to the target's Composure, and he can make one roll per hour of observation.</P><BR>",

To talk about that subject feels like blabbing the most sickeningly embarrassing and awkward topic possible, although the spell does not actually prevent the target from talking about it, should someone convince him to speak his shame."

Instead of reading individual minds and sifting through their thoughts, this spell allows the caster to get a vague and general sense of the attitudes and feelings of a large number of people. To cast this spell, the mage must be exceedingly familiar with the region where he is casting it. This region can range from a large apartment building or a neighborhood of few city blocks to an entire city. Use the rules for area-affecting spells, but with the special chart below. When casting this spell, the mage can attempt to get an exceedingly vague and general impression of what the people in the region are thinking about. Used in this fashion, the spell only reveals thoughts shared by a significant proportion of the people within the area. In addition, this spell only provides a very brief and general impression of such shared thoughts -- the caster might discover that most everyone within a single city block is thinking about the recent power outage, the widespread job cutbacks in the area, the noisy roadwork on a nearby street and rumors about a woman who appeared out of midair three days ago. Alternately, the caster can use Mind 4 to determine if a particular name, image, sound, face, or some other short phrase or simple sensory impression evokes a strong response from the people in the designated area. When used in this fashion, the spell both reveals the approximate proportion of the people who feel a particular way about the image or phrase and roughly how they feel about it. With the addition of Time magic, this spell can also be used to determine how residents of this region responded in the past. The complexity of receiving and analyzing so much information is the reason that this spell can only be performed as an extended action. When performing it, the caster typically sits down in front of a map or photograph of the area he is going to examine. He then sinks into a deep trance that continues until he either successfully casts the spell or gives up the attempt.</P><BR>",

Potential observers must reflexively roll Wits + Investigation to take note of the object's presence. Observers using Mage Sight may add Gnosis to the dice pool. A +2 bonus applies when the perceiver actively searches for the Enchanted Item with an instant action. Whenever an observer's attentions stray from the item, the user contests Wits + Investigation against a dice pool equal to the spell's Potency. If the observer loses, he absent-mindedly allows the item's existence or location to slip out of his conscious thoughts. A similar contest, using the same dice pool, occurs when an observer attempts to document the item's existence in notes, photographs or video footage. If the item wins, the observer neglects to take notes or distractedly fails to properly operate the recording device. This spell is best cast on small, unremarkable objects that can easily be lost amid a room's background clutter, even when exposed to plain sight. Examples include pens, staplers, magazines, shoes, buttons, cushions, household tools and bits of packaging. Dice bonuses to the observers' rolls accrue when the item is large, ostentatious or strikingly decorated, or in some other way difficult to miss. The item's owner and authorized users are not subject to the effects listed in the chart.

The mage also controls when and about what she dreams. For each success on this spell, the mage automatically succeeds with a single roll to remain awake after 24 hours of no sleep (that is, the roll need not even be made; she stays awake). She still suffers the dice penalties for impaired performance with each six hour period.

The mage could instead choose to remain asleep for a long time, for up to 24 hours per success. During sleep, she can control the content of her dreams.

In secret, she studied her fellow mages through scrying portals, calling their foremost conscious desires out of them, so they could be studied and the truth of the matter discerned. Lucia never found a lich, however, as none existed within the Consilium to find. Instead, she discovered that the rumor had been seeded by two Seers of the Throne who had quietly replaced Councilors, and that they were using the paranoia that the story engendered to gradually weaken any hope of concerted resistance when the time came for their allies to strike. Armed with this knowledge, Lucia petitioned for, and received, permission to eliminate the threat."

Some simply call up dreams of aspects of the subconscious to explore (or enjoy) them, while others use this experience as a crucible; relentlessly analyzing subconscious desires. The mage's most pressing present subconscious desire is drawn out of her, taking on ephemeral form. If the mage is dreaming or otherwise in direct contact with her subconscious, then she may choose the specific aspect of her Oneiros that she calls forth. With Mind 4, a mage whose consciousness is presently in the Temenos or the Dreamtime can spend a point of Mana to attempt to summon a morphean out of another individual who is physically present at the location of her body. With Space 2 and Mind 5, she may attempt to do so at sympathetic range (again, spending a point of Mana), though she must still be within the Temenos or Dreamtime, and the morphean will appear in Twilight near the summoner's body.

With some creatures (goats or exceedingly alien spirits, for example) this is largely an exercise in futility and frustration for anything more complicated than the most basic of concepts. Ideas, images and words can all be shared freely between the mage and another individual. The target cannot be compelled to act in any particular way, although the mage could use the telepathic link to try to socially persuade him (or to use other spells that do allow for psychic command). Only conscious thoughts are gleaned at this level. It requires Mind 4 to read someone's subconscious thoughts. The Duration at this level is transitory. Additional successes extend that time. With Mid 4, the mage can cast this spell with a prolonged Duration. With Mind 5, he can use advanced prolonged Duration factors.

The willworker does not serve as a &quot;psychic switchboard.&quot; With Mind 5, multiple minds can be &quot;networked.&quot; This web can be intruded or spied upon in the same manner as ordinary one-on-one telepathy by those with the means.

The autopilot can obey directions based on destination (e.g. &quot;Go to Louie's Pizza&quot;) if the caster knows the destination's location, or the autopilot can follow basic commands (e.g., &quot;Drive North to Warner and take a right,&quot; &quot;Accelerate and ram that blue sedan&quot;).

(It helps but is not necessary to cast Read the Depths first.) An individual could be made to forget where she parked her car, the fact that she likes strawberry ice cream, or even why she wears a wedding band. Naturally, short-term and less deeply ingrained memories are easier to manipulate than those that are long term or more fundamental to a person's identity, but just about any memory can be sculpted according a mage's desires. The mage might suffer a penalty, depending on how deep the memory to be altered lies. Once the spell expires, the memories return. During the spell's Duration, psychotherapy and hypnosis might be able to restore the victim's memories. Each success on the spellcasting roll levies a -1 dice penalty on any attempt to restore the subject's memory to normal (or to otherwise influence an implanted or altered memory). A subject cannot be made to forget that she is Awakened (or is otherwise a supernatural being of some sort) or how to use her paranormal abilities. That part of her identity is too deeply bound into the mind and soul alike to be tampered with. Virtue and Vice may not be changed at this level. They are facets of who a person is, rather than just a product of her memories. If a target is a mage with at least Mind 1, he might have an inkling via his Unseen Senses that he is attacked mentally. A reflexive Wits + Composure roll allows him to sense attempts to alter his memories. He can know nothing about the intrusion unless he casts magic (such as Third Eye) to learn more. Most mages react by first erecting a Mental Shield spell. This presence of this spell on a target cannot be detected unless its Potency is overcome by a Third Eye spell.</P>",

Use the rules for Goetic Evocation to design the spirit based on the number of successes scored. Instead of Possession, eidolons automatically start with the Living Fetter Numen. The mage's personality and beliefs control an eidolon's appearance and shape. The spirit takes an appearance that the mage associates with goodness. The spirit could look like a radiant, winged angel, one of the 18 Buddhist arhats, or like a historical figure she's always admired. In most cases, the eidolon either looks something like the mage or appears to be a parent, lover, or close friend. An eidolon can't be forced to give its mage Willpower points. On the other hand, it will explicitly point out opportunities for the mage to fulfill her Virtue, increasing the likelihood that she'll earn back spent Willpower points by &quot;doing the right thing.&quot; An eidolon also opposes its mage whenever she looks likely to either satisfy her Vice or act against her Virtue. Depending on the eidolon and the situation at hand, the spirit uses everything from calm conversation to physical intervention to keep the mage on a righteous path. Unlike a goetic demon, an eidolon is not automatically bound to follow the mage's orders, but it feels a duty of care and will usually help its host unless she's planning an immoral act. An advanced version of the spell, using Prime 5 and Spirit 5, can evoke another person's eidolon.</P><BR>",

He can interact with the angels and spirits of that sephira and gain wisdom and understanding of its principles. The exact effects of this wisdom varies; in general, if the mage overcomes the challenges and seals that guard the sephira's mysteries, he should earn 1-3 Arcane experience points depending on the difficulty of the challenge. According to Kabbalist doctrine, the key to Ascension is to use this spell to journey completely up the Tree of Life, from Malkhut all the way to Keter, navigating each sephira in turn.

The goal of the gathering matters little (Burning Man offers a generic focus on creativity, self-reliance, and ecstasy while something like the Harmonic Convergence was a conscious attempt to turn humanity's collective soul toward positive karma and dharma), but the gathering of people is a focus. Also important is that a number of the gatherers must be operating with some manner of psychoactive in their bloodstream (the number of dosed individuals isn't a hard or fast number, but one can assume that approximately 1/4 of the attendees should have recently imbibed some kind of entheogen). Another focus of the festival is a key symbol that serves as the literal center of the activities. At Burning Man, it is obviously the giant effigy (which may actually burn or may be a figure comprising neon tubes and car parts), while at other ceremonial festivals it may be a central tree representing Axis Mundi or a sacred figure (such as Om, some kind of Buddhist mandala, or a figure from Native American or Japanese symbology) laid across or etched into the ground. Music is the final focus. It may come from a drum circle, or may instead be trance music pulsing from a tower of speakers. It doesn't matter what kind of music it is, only that it's loud enough for the crowd to hear it. The caster then literally surfs the crowd - they pick him up and carry him about.

The Pulsa di Nura, as this spell is traditionally named, begins in the Kabbalist's preferred ritual space. An altar draped with red cloth (for Gevurah) and set with purple candles (for Yesod and Death) is the centerpiece of the ritual. As with most Kabbalist spells, it begins with chanting in the High Speech for a half an hour. Once the ritual proper is begun, the mage takes up a silver dagger (representing both Chokhmah and his desire to do harm), with which he traces the names of Michael and Kamael in the air above the altar. Finally, at the completion of the casting, he pierces an image of the desired target (or another object which has sympathy to the target) with the dagger, then transfers the object to a burning brazier to be consumed. If the ritual is performed during the astrological hour of Mars (for example, at dawn on a Tuesday), the Mana cost is waived. There is no common consensus as to the appropriate number of successes the willworker should target with this spell. Most agree that it should last no less than two days, so five successes are often allocated to Duration; alternately, the spell's conditional duration is often set so that the spell expires if the target deviates from a course of action the caster finds displeasing -- for example, a Pulsa di Nura cast on a businessman might be set to end if the target gives up his efforts to buy the apartment building that houses the mage's sanctum. Successes devoted to Potency range from one (if the caster only wishes to gently goad the target) to ten or more for truly Biblical-scale vengeance."

Some of this information is exceptionally sensitive, but even the most sensitive data must occasionally be given to individuals other than the order's trusted and highly placed members. To insure that they never reveal this information to anyone outside of the order, the leaders of the Guardians insist that anyone who is told certain pieces of vitally important information should be subjected to this magical oath. Such information includes the locations of items that might prove the existence of magic to Sleepers, the name of order members who have deeply infiltrated the ranks of the Seers of the Throne and other equally sensitive data. When taking this oath, the order requires that subjects also give up samples of hair, blood, and fingernails, so that the subjects will be easy to find with Space magic if they ever break this oath. Occasionally, this rote is cast upon an unknowing subject. While obviously less powerful if used in this fashion, Guardians sometimes perform this rote on members who have fallen under suspicion of being traitors or are simply exceedingly careless. In such cases, this rote is partly used as a test of loyalty. If the rote is never triggered, then the subject is obviously loyal; if it is triggered, then the caster is instantly aware of this fact and the subject is not able to reveal anything of importance to the order's enemies."

Whether to make the soul stone concealable, transportable or simply beautiful, a mage can use this spell to change the shape of her soul stone. The mage must touch her soul stone in order to affect it with this spell. She requires only one success on the casting, after which the stone changes to whatever form she desires. Simple shapes are easiest -- stones, blocks, things that appear to be plants or parts of a creature. If she wants to make the soul stone appear as something strongly contradictory to the nature of her Path, she loses two dice from her roll. Making a Moros' stone appear as any living thing or an Acanthus' as a shard of bone would qualify. Forcing the soul stone to hold the form of something more complex, such as a pistol or a light bulb, is harder. Doing so requires an extended Intelligence + Crafts roll to build the Imago, because the mage must fully understand the target object, before a successful casting of the spell. The target number might be three successes for a light bulb but five for an automatic rifle, and each roll takes 15 minutes. If she insists on changing her soul stone's form without crafting the Imago carefully beforehand, she subtracts a number of dice from her roll equal to what would have been the target number on the Intelligence + Crafts roll. Such an involved process is only necessary if the mage wishes her soul stone to be a functioning tool. She can make it appear to be a gun or a yo-yo while sparing the complexity with much greater ease. With five dots in Mind, a mage may use this spell on another mage's soul stone. Unless the other mage is present and willing, his soul stone naturally resists the change by subtracting its creator's Gnosis from the casting roll.</P><BR>",

The copy of the mage's mind remains in stasis until the book is opened and read, though it does remember conversations with previous readers.

If the fiery creature tries to burn a person, it has an attacking dice pool equivalent to its creator's Gnosis + 2, and causes lethal damage.

The caster could therefore create, say, a sentient computer or something similar. He could put the mind in a form incapable of anything other than telepathic interaction, but such is exceedingly cruel and almost always leads to the creation's insanity, unless the consciousness is frequently interacted with or created without a need or desire for contact. A simple success creates a bodiless, Twilight consciousness (as in the Psychic Projection spell) with the following traits: Intelligence 1, Wits 1, Resolve 1, Presence 1, Manipulation 1, Composure 1, Virtue, and Vice. Additional successes are allocated to increase the mind's Mental and Social Attributes on a one-for-one basis. In addition, successes can be allocated to certain Mental or Social Skills, such as Academics or Empathy, to give the consciousness a knowledge base or some facility for interacting with others. The mind has as much of its creator's basic personality and memories as the caster wants it to have (although its ability to reason using those memories or even recall them when needed is based on its assigned Intelligence). By adding other appropriate Arcana to this spell, such a mind could be tethered to a vessel made specifically to hold it (such as a body created with Life 5). Note that at this level of mastery, this spell cannot be given an indefinite Duration (i.e., the mind cannot have a &quot;natural&quot; life span of human years). The consciousness dissolves when the spell expires. Unless the creation is specifically designed to accept the inevitability of its own dissolution without emotional trauma, a Wisdom degeneration roll may be required for the creator (unless he has Wisdom 2 or lower). The mage could, however, recast the spell before the previous one expires, giving the mind a new Duration. Note that such extension is an exception to the normal rules for spell control.

But, when Guardians fail to execute this heavy burden, others must sometimes sully their own hands with ugly necessities. Accepting the price of his failure, however, a Guardian can assimilate the wickedness of others and purify it in the crucible of his ongoing sacrifice, redeeming the virtuous and embracing his own damnation thereby. This spell enables the Guardian to do just that, drawing out the sins of others and taking their weight upon his own soul, so sparing them the pain of wickedness and nudging them back toward virtue. Upon successfully casting this spell, the Guardian takes on the spiritual burden of the most recent sin against Wisdom for which another mage suffered degeneration. (Use the Duration factors given for prolonged spells to determine how far back the caster can reach in his attempt to consume the subject's sin.) There exist certain interesting complications to this process, however. First, the subject must be willing and desirous of sincere repentance. Of course, part and parcel with a failed degeneration check is a feeling of vindication in one's improper actions, so this true longing for redemption is often easier said than done, and usually works better with either those who are, by nature, intensely virtuous or, conversely, those who have perceived an overarching pattern of wrongful behavior in themselves and wish to turn back from the path of hubris. Whatever the case, it is only a genuine commitment to self-betterment that empowers this spell's soul-mending effects. Second, the spell isn't a guarantee; merely a chance. The subject receives the opportunity to re-roll the degeneration check, automatically subject to a +1 die bonus for sincere remorse. If this check succeeds, though, the subject regains the lost Wisdom without cost and loses any derangement gained through that particular instance of degeneration. (derangements from other sources -- including other instances of Wisdom degeneration -- remain.)  Third, the Guardian can cast this spell only once on a given subject between instances of degeneration. (In other words, no &quot;going back&quot; to the next instance of degeneration and trying to undo that one as well, thus enabling another willworker to potentially skyrocket in Wisdom.) Fourth, the Guardian must pay the piper, as it were, by accepting the burden of sin upon his own soul (and regardless of whether or not the subject actually succeeds in his &quot;second chance&quot; to feel regret for his prior actions). In the case of any act at least 2 dots above the Guardian's present Wisdom score on the hierarchy of sins, this entails no degeneration check: His soul is simply too scarred already to suffer appreciably on account of this new burden. In the case of sins within one step of the Guardian's present Wisdom score, in either direction, this involves a degeneration check for the Guardian, as normal, subject to all the customary consequences for either success or failure. In the event of a sin at least 2 dots below the Guardian's present Wisdom score, this entails an automatic loss of Wisdom and the customary subsequent check to resist gaining a derangement.</P><BR>",

In addition to the spells and rotes concealed within The Codex of Lies, the grimoire itself bestows certain interesting benefits upon its possessor. First and foremost, the Codex grants a +1 modifier to all degeneration checks made by its current owner, as well as a +1 modifier to the roll to avoid gaining a derangement in the event of an unsuccessful degeneration check. Whether this is on account of metaphysical proximity to Plures' ideology of eternal sacrifice or some other reason is unknown; some Guardians have spent years researching the seemingly enhanced moral and psychological resiliency of an owner of the Codex, but to no avail. Further, regular study of the Codex grants a Guardian of the Veil (or any that manage to decipher its many tiers of hidden meaning) a +2 modifier to any rolls to influence, infiltrate, or otherwise interact with the structures, policies, and procedures of nearly any Sleeper occult society wholly or partially of Western European origin, with traditions (whether legitimately handed down, pilfered, or acquired by whatever other means) spanning back to at least the early 18th century. This insight is the result of regular perusal and contemplation of the symbolism integrated into the  text, and so functions only for one who has reviewed the grimoire within the past month. This bonus drops to a +1 in dealings with more modern societies deliberately cast in the mold of more antiquated fellowships of this sort, since many of the prominent symbols and ideals of such organizations have entered into the common consciousness and are thus co-opted by such groups."
