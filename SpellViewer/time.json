No information about the object or target of this spell is conveyed other than age.

In this case, the caster can perform an extended scrutiny action, with each roll taking one turn.

The Storyteller decides what the future holds for the target, knowing that knowledge of the future is often enough to change that future. A woman who is told she will be a store clerk for the rest of her life might then quit her job to go back to school. Some mages don't even need to cast this spell to effect change. Their reputations for prophecy can be used to make others think they have read the future by means of magic. In this way, a mage might influence a friend's behavior in hopes of turning her toward a more productive life by scaring her with predictions of just where her current path will lead. The same person can be targeted with this spell only once every 24 hours. Any attempts to augur him again before 24 hours have passed reveal meaningless echoes of myriad possible actions the target could take, but with no clue as to which might occur, or which is even more problematic than the others.

Without the use of Space 2, she can do this only for an exact spot in which she was or is. She can look only at what was going on while she was physically present in such a location. Generally speaking, the past is much easier to read than the future (since the past's variables are already locked into place), giving a more-or-less objective view of how things unfolded at a given time, in a given place. The mage declares the time and place that she wishes to view, and casting dice pool is modified by temporal sympathy. Each success allows the mage to view up to one turn of time in that place, beginning at the moment declared during casting (such as &quot;Midnight on New Years Day, 1999, at Times Square&quot;). She views events in real time (it takes one turn of current time to review one turn of past time) as if through a camera placed amidst the scene, but she can fast forward and replay any part within the viewing period.

The mage's hands move in a blur almost too swift to follow, and the projectiles fly faster than wind resistance and the constraints of physics should allow. Note that the mage must release three projectiles (from a single weapon, in the case of guns, bows, slings, and the like) to use the first stage of autofire, 10 for the second stage and 20 for the third (meaning that the constraint of how many projectiles he has on hand may limit his options).

He grabs hold of the threads of time and pulls himself back one turn, allowing him to choose a different approach to a situation (though, from the perspective of all save the willworker himself, this is the first and only time this moment has occurred or will occur). This spell can be cast anytime in the Initiative roster from when the caster performed his action until his place in the roster in the next turn. If the player does not declare this casting before then, the previous turn cannot be replayed. If the casting roll fails, the mage does not rewind time (he essentially spends that turn casting and nothing else). If it succeeds, he rewinds himself through time and can then replay his action from the last turn, changing it however he wants (he might decide not to the open the door that released a spirit guardian, for example). Doing so, of course, might change other characters' actions that occurred after his action in the turn he replays and before he casts this spell. This spell cannot undo any effects the mage suffered the first time he experienced the turn that he replays. If he got shot in that turn, and then casts this spell to replay that action, he still suffers from  the gunshot wound, even though he might decide to dodge in his replay of the turn, causing the bullet to miss him. (And if it does hit him, he suffers a second wound!). This spell does not erase the effects of time on the mage. It merely allows him to step back in the river of time by one turn and replay its flow. Although he cannot reverse any harm he himself has suffered, it can be instrumental in allowing the mage to save the lives of others. Those other than the caster may feel a sense of d&eacute;j&#0224; vu about the situation, but for them the caster's new action is the first and only time this turn has happened or will happen. Participants remember the turn only as it has just been played, not as it was previously played before Shifting Sands altered it.

		"Effect" : "This magic removes information about a target from the past, so that the information cannot be detected through temporal senses such as Postcognition (Time 2). The spell has to target a specific person, object, or place. Neither the target nor the world suffers physical or mental change; a person who had a span of her past erased would still remember that time, and so would anyone she was with. By itself, Erase History only blocks attempts to observe through time. Unlike a mere warding spell, however, Erase History actually destroys information about a target's past -- the gap in time can't be broken or bypassed with a stronger spell. Erase History, therefore, offers a perfect defense against magical attempt to probe a target's past -- but any mage must realize something very strange is going on when Postcognition on a person can find no trace of her existence between 10 and 11 o'clock last Tuesday. When most mages use Erase History, the subject's past merely becomes undetectable: Another mage using Postcognition simply can't find the target during that timespan. Doomsday Clocks are worse. They leave gaps in history that inspire horror in Time-sensing mages. Part of the past is gone, leaving a soul-shuddering void. Every memory or record of what (or who) was destroyed is a little Time-Paradox -- one thread of reality pulled out, fraying the whole. Erase History requires a simple success, but the character's dice pool is penalized by the span of time he wants to occlude. Use the Duration chart for Prolonged spells to find the dice penalty. If a character has Time 5, use the Advanced Prolongation chart (so blocking an Indefinite span of time, such as occluding an entire human life or the history of a building, would require Time 5 and a -10 dice penalty). Large or multiple targets can impose further penalties. If a mage wants to block a section of time that itself is far in the past, use the modifiers for sympathetic ties, but for the temporal connection. The less accurately you can define the span of time you want to occlude, the weaker the sympathetic tie will be. For instance, erasing &quot;Bob's history between 8 and 10 p.m. last Tuesday, when he was at that motel&quot; would provide a Known connection: You know exactly what time, by clock, calendar, and what the subject was doing. Having an object tied to a specific event in that timespan, such as the wrapper of a cheeseburger Bob ate in the motel room, would raise the connection to Intimate. However, hiding &quot;Bob's visit to the motel some time last week&quot; would provide, at most, an Acquainted connection. If you had no idea when Bob might have visited the motel, the connection would be Unknown, and the spell would fail; and, of course, you would need Bob's presence to block that episode in his past, anyway. A mage can also perform Erase History through an Extended casting, and try to accumulate enough successes to erase a span of history from temporal sensing.</P><BR>",

The mage casts the spell on himself, storing it for later use (this storage counts against the mage's Spell Tolerance). Casting the spell requires the expenditure of one Mana and a single success on the casting roll. This spell may have its Duration increased to one day by spending an additional Mana during the casting. Only one instance of Duplicate may exist on a mage at any time. Activating the stored spell is a reflexive action that costs one Mana. Once the spell is active, the next instant action performed by the mage will be doubled as though the mage had performed the action twice. Any expenditure required by the repeated action must be paid for twice, and any penalties accrued by that action will be inflicted twice.</P><BR>",

While he could previously move things forward in time for a few turns using the Temporal Stutter spell, mastery of this level allows him to move an object far into the future, perhaps to keep it out of enemy hands or to ensure that only an heir will wield it. The number of successes determines how far into the future the object can be sent. The mage can opt to send it to any time between now and that allowed by his successes. The object appears at the future time in the exact same space it occupies in the present, unless Space 2 is added to locate it elsewhere. (See the Apportation spell.) The drawback to this spell is that, once cast, the object cannot be retrieved, except at the point in the future in which it appears. It is said that archmasters of Time have the power to reach forward and snatch back objects that have been sent forward.</P>",

For each success accrued in the casting of this spell, the mage may send a single point of Mana from her current total forward into the future, using the table given for the Future Legacy spell to determine how long the character has to recover her Mana. Because the caster attunes her spell to the threads of her own destiny and because the Mana within her is essentially stored within her Awakened spirit, she effectively chooses the moment that constitutes her &quot;hour of need&quot; and may freely recover the Mana at that time, circumventing even wards and other barriers that prevent the flow of such energies; the Mana exists out of time and place until it is needed and never actually &quot;goes&quot; anywhere. No willworker may have more points of Mana readied for use in this way than she has dots in Fate or Prime, whichever is less. The Mana sent forward is lost from the character's current total and recovered points may not bring her over the normal maximum Mana permitted by her Gnosis.

He cannot, however, change his soul's history, remaking his magical past (he cannot change his Path, Gnosis, or Arcana). Each success allows the mage to shift one dot from a mundane trait (an Attribute, Skill, or Merit, but not a magical trait such as Gnosis or an Arcanum) to another within the same trait category (dots of Social Attributes switch with other Social Attributes, etc.), up to his normal maximum within a given category (five dots for most humans). (Dots cannot be added directly to or subtracted directly from Advantages.) It is as if he had made different choices in the past, leading to different personal results. For example, in his newly rewritten past, a mage went to the gym rather than to the library he actually frequented in his real past, allowing him to shift traits from Mental Attributes to Physical Attributes. Note that changing a number that has derived characteristics (Composure or Stamina, for example) alters any such derived characteristics appropriately (say, Willpower or Health). When the spell expires, the caster's real history is restored and his traits return to their original distribution.</P><BR>",

The mage &quot;fixes&quot; a moment in time when the spell is completed. Thereafter, an invisible, ethereal &quot;lifeline&quot; connects the caster to that moment as it moves into the past. At any time thereafter, the mage can choose to return to that moment as an instant action, simply by willing it. This ends the spell as the temporal lifeline &quot;snaps back&quot; into the past and disappears. The Mana cost of the temporal lifeline cannot be regained so long as the lifeline exists. The mage returns to the chosen moment and all the intervening &quot;time&quot; essentially never happened, although the mage remembers it as though it did. It can be considered a &quot;possible&quot; future in that the mage can take actions to change the outcome of events. So, for example, a mage who casts this spell before going into a dangerous ruin, then encounters a deadly trap, can activate the lifeline, returning to the moment before she entered the ruin, and make a different choice (assuming the trap wasn't so sudden and deadly that the mage died instantly before she was able to use the lifeline). Once Temporal Lifeline is cast, a mage can even use spells such as Temporal Pocket and Temporal Stutter to move forward faster in time in order to reach a particular future point, then &quot;snap back&quot; to the past using the lifeline. It is impossible for the same caster to fix the &quot;end point&quot; at two temporal lifelines closer than 24 hours together or to have more than one temporal lifeline active at a time. Thus, after activating the lifeline and returning to the past, the mage cannot cast this spell again until at least 24 hours later.</P><BR>",
