It allows you to write natural sentences with placeamrks where you would like to include random words. This is done by using double curly braces {{placeholder}} with a list of possible {{words or phrases|phrases or words}} to use seperated by the bar \"|\" character. When the text is transformed a random option will be chosen from each PlaceMark. It's that simple!\n\nThe {{magic internet navigation buttons|links}} {{on the right|on the starboard side of your browser|over there -->}} (once they exist) will be all of your available PlaceMark Scripts. Right now I've (got the intention to) put a bunch of helpful tutorials that will help you familiarise yourself with the interface and get you started making your own fantastic PlaceMark Scripts.\n\nThe {{results are|output is}} {{parsed|transformed}} as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) {{for your convinience|so you don't have to}}.",
