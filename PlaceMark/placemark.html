#Introduction

This {{awesome|fantastic|terrific|splendiferous}} {{website|webpage|online tool|magic portal}} {{helps|assists|just gets stuff done}} {{creating|making|assembling}} {{random|natural|funky}} {{output|text|sentences|works of art}}.

This is done using PlaceMark script, which is {{what you see|}} in the {{upper|top}} text area above.  It allows you to put in placeholders using double curly braces {<wbr/>{placeholder}<wbr/>} with a list of possible {{words or phrases|phrases or words}} to use seperated by the bar "|" character.  When the text is transformed a random option will be chosen from each PlaceMark.  It's that simple!

The {{magic internet navigation buttons|links}} {{on the right|on the starboard side of your browser|over there -->}} (once they exist) will be all of your available PlaceMark Scripts.  Right now I've (got the intention to) put a bunch of helpful tutorials that will help you familiarise yourself with the interface and get you started making your own fantastic PlaceMark Scripts.

The {{results are|output is}} {{parsed|transformed}} as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) {{for your convinience|so you don't have to}}.

#{{Features|Cool stuff about PlaceMark}}
##{{Blanks|Using nothing|Leaving things empty}}
If you want to put something or nothing, you can do that by leaving an option blank.  This will put an empty string in the list of possible choices.  For example:

*A figure approaches you from the shadows.{{  His face is difficult make out in the poor lighting.|}}  He asks you for the time{{ and as he turns you see the flash of a knife blade under his coat|}}.*  

##{{Nesting|Putting PlaceMarks in other PlaceMarks}}
PlaceMarks can be nested inside another PlaceMark.  For example you might want to describe a piece of clothing, so you might want to say it's a coat or hat.  Then you might want to say it's a floppy hat or a long coat.  So you would do the following:

*The figure is wearing a {{{{floppy |broad |}}hat|{{long |short |}}coat}} and seems to be nervous about something.*

## {{Tables|Lists}}
* Define tables to look up seperately then reference them so you don't have a massive list in your text all the time.  It looks like this:
The shadowy figure disappeared to the {<wbr/>{::cardinalpoint}<wbr/>} becomes:
*The shadowy figure disappeared to the {{::cardinalpoint}}*

When the table is defined like this:  
{<wbr/>{<wbr/>{cardinalpoint:::  
North|  
South|  
East|  
West}<wbr/>}<wbr/>}

{{{cardinalpoint:::
North|
South|
East|
West}}}

## Functions
* Ranges work.  Try {<wbr/>{range::1-100}<wbr/>} to get a results like this: {{range::1-100}}, {{range::1-100}}, {{range::1-100}}

## {{Planned Features|Stuff I want to add|Things that I think would be {{fun|cool|useful|not terrible|ground breaking|profitable|are so awesome they would unravel the very fabric of the space time continuum, and destroy the entire universe! Granted, that's a worse case scenario. The destruction might in fact be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy.}}}}

### Aliases
* An alias is easy to define.  If you want to use compasspoint as a table/list name instead of cardinal just call the table from the table like so:
{{{compasspoint:::{{::cardinalpoint}}}}}

### {{Saving and loading|Not having to cut and paste stuff in and out}}
* This single page site is great, but there's no way to save what you've done to come back to it later.  I can do that.  I will do that.   Give me a little while and it'll happen.

### Versioning
* Because if you save over your script but didn't mean to, I don't want you to lose the stuff you made.

### {{Functions|Methods|Not just lists}}
* Things like maths evaluations {<wbr/>{}<wbr/>}
* Number ranges eg. {<wbr/>{range:::1-10}<wbr/>}
* This leads to being able to do things like {<wbr/>{roll:::3d10}<wbr/>}

### Imports
* So you've made a PlaceMark Script that describes a commoner nicely.  But now you want to create a random encounter that includes a commoner.  Instead of redoing all your hard work, you want to just be able to go {<wbr/>{import::commoner}<wbr/>} don't you?  Yes you do, because that would be awesome.  I'll get right onto that after I've made saving and loading a thing.

### {{Collaboration|Working with your {{friends|enemies|cohorts|group|buddies|crew}}|{{Using|Stealing|Borrowing}} other peoples stuff}}
* Right now this is just hosted on a single page on github.  If enough peope are interested I'll put it on it's own server and give people user accounts.  Then we can:
** Share our Scripts
** Import other peoples scripts into your scripts (see above)
** Favourite other peoples scripts
** Vote on scripts
** Comment on scripts
** Categorise scripts to make them easier to find.
